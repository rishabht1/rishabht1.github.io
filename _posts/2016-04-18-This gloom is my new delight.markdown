I float in a sea of illusions, half in half out  
A limitless pool of water, within the confines of this mind  
I know but I deny, I do not succumb, I run  
Into the denseness of the woods, deep inside  
To deem a virtue, bare and hollow  

Then you come and push me deeper  
In the dark here, I have made my world  
I no longer long for the sun rays  
I fear they will blind me, burn me  
This gloom is my new delight, an eternal bliss  

My mind is vended, in fact, I auctioned it  
You said the price will buy me my dreams  
As always, I believed you  
It was all very effortless, it never pained  
What in world can oblivion not get you?  

I sleep all day, my eyes have grown perpetually soar  
A murky vision is all I endure now, with an extinct past  
Already settled with the sun, thoughts no longer perturb me  
I am a lamb now, situated in disguise  
Alone but not lonely, your voice never leaves my side  

I am waiting for you to come in this creation, where  
We’ll lay down counting stars –  
the same ones all over again.
