One of the most sought after days in the Indian parliament is the day when the Union Finance Minister of the country presents the budget for that fiscal year. People are drawn to the TV screens, trying to make a real time analysis of what impacts would the different provisions and allocations have on their lives. Presenting of the budget is basically allocation of resources where an effort is put to do the allocation in the most efficient and optimized manner. In a country of the scale of India it is very evident indeed that the budget is taken differently by different people on the basis of what it offers them. Then, there is also a comprehensive commentary which is done by journalists, economists and other experts. 

The day following the day of the budget, Brookings India scholars were part of a briefing session on the budget to dissect and discuss what the various section of the budget meant for their fields of expertise. **Dr. Harsha Vardhana Singh**, Executive Director - Brookings India, remarked on the trade and infrastructure side, **Dr. Shamika Ravi** commented on health sector and also touched upon gender dynamics, **Dr. Rahul Tongia** observed the implications on the energy sector and the organisation’s chairman - **Vikram Singh Mehta** convened the session with his opinion on the overall efficiency and assertiveness of the budget.

Dr. Harsha Vardhana went first and enunciated on the following points:
* The background - This budget cannot be seen outside the aegis of the recent demonetization of higher currency notes in India which shaved off 0.5% of the Indian economy in terms of GDP. There are elements in the budget which take forward the purpose of demonetization towards a more monitored economy. Dr. Singh also pointed out the missed opportunities where the government could have made stronger pronouncements in sync with demonetization.
* He mentioned how the budget laid down segments of social importance with an eye on the growth with social equity. The Oxfam ranking of India as second worst on social equality was put to light. 
* The budget laying emphasis on SMEs and employment was talked about. Dr. Singh remarked that in India with a large impact focus of schemes and provisions the impact threshold would lie somewhere between 40-80%: 80% would mean a highly successful execution on part of the government.

Ensuing Dr. Singh, Dr. Shamika Ravi expounded on her views on the budget:
* Dr. Ravi called the budget a plumbing budget focused more over repairing the existing model and make the economy more formal.
* She talked about some key aspects like getting rid off MCI (Medical Council of India) and the restructuring of UGC (University Grant Commission). The UGC would be remoulded to be accreditation based instead of centralised and also it would follow an outcome based follow up of universities.
* On the healthcare sector, Dr. Ravi said that although significant improvements were expected through the budget, **women health was still limited to her reproductive health. She stressed on the need to look beyond female reproductive health and incorporate the required nutritional interventions.** She also highlighted how the Women and Child ministry hasn't been very creative but they are getting substantially funded. 
* As per Dr. Ravi, the Crop Insurance Scheme looked ambitious and rudimentary at the same time. The process of governance of public sector banks was also put under the lens by her.
* Other points covered by her were the big push for affordable housing for all sanctioned under the budget. Demonetization had helped in bringing down the prices of high-end houses whereas this budget focused on affordability at all levels. The Railway pricing as a function of competition from highways and airways was acknowledged as a good move.

Next up, Dr. Rahul Tongia highlighted on the following points:
* Dr. Rahul referring to Sherlock Holmes, commented on seeing where the dog didn’t bark: some attributes which were left uncovered in the budget. The need to mask a system level assessment of entities and institutions was rendered extremely important according to him. 
* He picked up on the rural and village electrification provisions and questioned the definition of electrification and its evolution with time. 
* The environment and carbon tax although not present in the budget explicitly, according to Dr. Tongia it had its implicit roots in the Economic Survey of India. 
* The operational nature of the solar trench, right to electricity - basic phone charging and use of CFLs, delta funding to state energy institutions were some other aspects captured. 
* Dr. Tongia mentioned the missing emphasis on clean energy and innovation in case of what the budget holds for the energy sector in India.  
* The intertwining nature of kerosene subsidy with electrification and health was also brought out in Dr. Tongia’s commentary. 

Vikram Mehta expressed his surprise on the budget for not being a populist in the times of upcoming elections in some important states. The budget had little freebies to offer. Disappointment was shown on the aspect of the budget not keeping up with technological advances in terms of not spending enough on R&D and clean energy. 

The discussion later shifted to the mention of UBI (Universal Basic Income) in India in the ESI. Dr. Ravi called it a way to rationalise subsidies and said it cannot go hand in hand with the existing state of subsidies in India. 

Towards the end, questions were taken from the attendees wherein the UDAY scheme, FDI, secondary and tertiary healthcare and admin reforms were discoursed upon.
