In the smallest and closest form I lay  
In a consuming pursuit  
From purple of dawn to orange daze of dusk  
The nape bent inwards along the spine  
In a bizarre jigsaw I find myself enclosed  
For in the melee of voices  
The mind is in a state of a quiet tumult  
Its rhythm and roar lulling the mind  
This resigned self-exclusion feels like the only home  

An emotional coup d'etat;  
Unfolding inner conflicts  
Experiencing paradoxes  
Reconciling opposites  
Blandest phrases turned to sentiment.  
Smothering emotional density in various shades of intensity  

The sacredâ€™s haunting of the the profane  
Or the other way round  
Trapped inside a mental ghetto  
I am robbed of my poetry  
A negative and deprecatory light is the  
Only thing that enters from the crack  
Floating in the formless form,  
I circle the bazaars and roam the streets  
Through drunken dens and muttering fleets  
Sands of fleeting life, passing shows that fade  
And a melange of other landscapes created inside the mindscape  
I am catching my thoughts before they could go deep  

Coming back into the womb  
To heal a wound or two  
And embrace the eclipse of eyes  
Tricking the raging and roaring into softness  
Diagnosing and curing without knowing the disease  
Trying to listen to the;  
Syllable that permeates all things.
