Author - **Gabriel García Márquez**

*<p align = "center">“When he was alone, Jose Arcadio Buendia consoled himself with the dream of the infinite rooms. He dreamed that he was getting out of bed, opening the door and going into an identical room with the same bed with a wrought-iron head, the same wicker chair, and the sma small picture of the Virgin of Help on the back wall. From that room he would go into another that was just the same, the door of which would open into another one just the same, the door of which would open into another one just the same, and then into another one exactly alike, and so on to infinity.”</p>*

If you are a big fan of imaginative fiction writing this book is for you. If you admire reading about how the cycle of life circles back and comes back to the same point then this book is for you. If you want to read about topics of the earliest tussles between the Conservatives and the Liberals then also this book is for you. If you love to read a lunatic writer who creates crazy characters, moony places and still is able to transport you into the world of his words then too this book is for you. I have endless analogies and reasons to convince you why this book is for you. After having read the book I would say that I am for this book.

The genre of OHYOS is magical realism. It is basically embedding magic into reality and then observing how things and instances shape. OHYOS is a story of a civilization, just that the weirdness of its characters grows with time. All the characters go through a span of solitude, lost into the world of their uncanny activities. The story revolves around 7 generations of the Buendia family, fighting the ideas of various prejudices, superstitions, and a lot of time invoking the same.  

Something which is exceedingly weird is that the characters’ names are all similar to one another. There are 22 characters carrying the name Aureliano, 5 with the name Arcadio, 3 Remedios and 2 Ursulas. I was again and again reading back to check which Aureliano or Arcadio is being written about and when was he born. The confusion touches epitome when Garcia refers some Aureliano way back in the story line. I still cannot decide what would have been a better option for Garcia, to name them alike or to have unique names for all the characters keeping in mind plentitude of characters in the book.

The world and lifestyle depicted in OHYOS is typical of its kind. The story is framed in Mocondo, a village where fools turn wise and wise turn into fools. The words wise and fool mean their complete extremes and not just moderates. Or I would say, it’s a continuation. The characters raise up to become wise and when they touch the highest standards of wisdom, it’s their time to turn into fools and the same case in fools to wise.

The book may seem small in the number of pages, but the storyline is very long. Hundred years as the title says. Maybe it seemed long to me because of the number of characters. When different stories of various characters are recited, the time halts as we are turning pages but not moving forward in time. To me, this book was staggeringly occupying but at the same time I would call it a difficult read.

One important aspect of OHYOS is relationships. As everything in this book complicates itself so does the relationships. There are many instances of incest (between brother-sister, aunt-nephew). Various shades of relations are showcased (an indifferent father, a concubine, a tiger-mom). Most of the relationships are extremely complex and develop at surprising times. Just when the story smoothens, one or the other protagonist is hit by a hammer on the head and he/she alters the course by formulating a unorthodox intimacy with some other character.

The philosophy of the book is the inevitable and inescapable repetition of history. The protagonists at all the instances are bounded to their past. Their names decide their strengths and interests (and yes their level of lunacy). Garcia pictorially portrays that all the efforts in life are centered on discovering and deciphering the secrets of our own life and our own past and when these efforts triumphant our lives cease to exist.
