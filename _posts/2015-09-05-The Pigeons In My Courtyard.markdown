I see you daily, in my court,  
You come and gait slowly in circles.  
Round the grub, I put for you.  
Someday they are crumbs,  
Someday millets, or pulses,  
Pallets of the leftovers, in bits.  

This has been a long story,  
On the same position of the sun.  
Neither I miss, nor do you.  
The floor of my courtyard is cold,  
You like it here, I can see.  
You don’t soar away with the last grain.  

Today, my friends, is the last day.  
The winds have changed.  
I am going across the hills,  
To a distant land, with no court.  
Eat as much you can today,  
Stay as long as you can today.  

I know you will find a new yard,  
I know that even after you don’t see these morsels,  
You’ll always fly over my house.  
I know I’ll look out of that window,  
Assuming every pigeon in the sky as you.  

Both of us seeking warmth in hindsight.
