**Nine Lives – Encounters with the Holy in Modern India**

**Author – William Dalrymple**

Is India a land of make-believe? How intimately do we understand our country, its charms and the way it is changing? Talking about the religious and spiritual side of our nation, we can never ignore that India is a profoundly sacred land. We have 2.5 million places of worship compared to 1.5 million schools and 75,000 hospitals. Tourism is almost synonymous with pilgrimage. Yes, these are facts about MODERN CONTEMPORARY INDIA.

Now, the other set of questions. What comes to mind when we speak of Indian spirituality? And is there some misinterpretation in its outlook? The missionaries’ ranting on the sensuous immoral pagan sex, Madam Blavatsky chasing ectoplasm and Allen Ginsberg talking about discovering the vibes of lightness at the ghats of Banaras are some of the interpretations. Then there is the Oriental perspective which calls the Orient a dominion of hordes and despots of spirituality. And then a more general perception which links the ideas of Indian spirituality as dogmatic and occult.

But amongst all these and a million other ways of looking at this humongously diversified set of practices and narratives, there are a number of hidden stories, experiences, anecdotes which trail on the lines of these customs but at the same time add to the aesthetics of it.

‘Nine Lives’ covers nine such accounts of exceptionally ordinary people. Each account carries a narrative from the person plus a background description of the activity they are indulged in. The narrative is based on that individual’s journey into that particular routine and their spiritual elucidation of that practice. The portrayal of the milieu in which the pursuit is set and the historical baseline from which it has been brought up were the highlight for me in each story.

Again, this book is not about people going to the Kumbha Mela, pilgrims going to Vaishno Devi or Mecca. It is also not about the way Ganesh Visarjan is carried out or the decimation of Raavana on Dusshehra. These people are also not an Osho or a Shri Shri Ravi Shankar or the person Jobs/Zuckerberg got their enlightenment from. These people are like the jholi-waala you could see wandering through the roads or a performer at a regional deity’s raati-joga. These are people who drive the folk culture of their regions.

The approach that William Dalrymple has followed with this book is to go without any authorial interference. The questions asked to these people do not seem directed at a particular conclusion, rather the responses unshadow multidimensional facets of their lives. The stories revolve around totally consummate devotion and also allows room for a candid reflection on the concerns and virtues of the influences from the world outside.

The stories are about a Jain nun and her rigorous asceticism, a dancer who is worshipped as a part time god, a female mystic who drinks from skulls and inhabits a cremation ground, a Tibetan monk who takes up arms for protection of his faith, a Sufi artist who talks about threats from the Taliban, a bard from Rajasthan who orally narrates epics word to word for hours straight out of his memory, an idol-maker who puts life into the statues, a temple devdasi (courtesan) contracted by AIDS and the Iktara player who leaves the amenities of his home at a young age.

This book provided the inroads into a completely different and unknown side of Indian piety. When at a time there is this continuous and escalating tensions due to religious infringements, it served as a canopy from all the fanatical frivolity. A lot of these people did express a fear towards losing out on their tradition and art as their successive generation lures towards outside opportunities. Still, their beliefs are unshaken when it comes to what they think as a path towards ultimate fulfillment and at no point of time did they not come up with a consistent explanation behind what they believe and do.

For me, as I have stated above, it added the aesthetic to spirituality. Lodging in and out of the limited and narrowed religious debates, these regional and small communities offer a fresh insight into how wide and multifaceted the arrangement of devotion is in our country.
