I am lying down unmoving  
Eyes wide open, seldom-blinking  
The night is dark and lonely  
Reminiscing, I travel into quondam  
As if a time portal has opened up  
I enter a trance and there it comes --  
The most silent hour of my night.  

Yes it is my night, as it deludes me away from sleep  
I lay in its arms : captive  
Profound thoughts come and pass.  
Each stealing a share of my sleep.  
I blame them guilty, why wouldn't I?  

The silence starts ascending  
The sound of no sound gets high:   
A deafening sensation  
Not to be heard but felt  
A silent shrieking.  

The most silent hour of my night is the slowest too  
It crawls out the ardour, the energy inside  
I could feel the decomposition within  
But as it passes out and as I hit bottom  
The background blurs and your face appears  
It is the closest I have seen you  
The lucid most that my mind could draw you  
The tightening of the chin as your lips move  
The contour that forms around your mouth as you smile  
The fervour in the eyes and the tan under them  
And the perpetual ingenuity in their reflection  
Replenishes back every ounce that has drained  
The most silent hour of my night was tough  
But I owe it for the journey it took me on  
For the end was so ravishing.
