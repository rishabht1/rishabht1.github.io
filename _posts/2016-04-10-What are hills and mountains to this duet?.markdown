That gleam in the eyes ascends me to blankness  
Or a transition into a different me, feeble  
It spurs somewhere deep inside, abysmally deep  
A state I cannot single out from a trance  

The profound cycle of frenzy to dismay and back; recurs  
Wrecking and replenishing at the same time--  
That coalesced notion of vigor and fragility.  
An existence spinning on the credence, that  
A stint will befall, closing in a vast expanse.  
An intimacy that sees no bound, utmost  

An episode, wholly sacrosanct, will tiptoe in  
What are hills and mountains to this duet?  
All coerced to bow down to a splendor so vivid.  

You. Me. And my musings.
