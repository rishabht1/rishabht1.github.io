# Chief of Defence Staff

better coordination between the 3 services

as recommended by both the Kargil Review Committee led by K Subrahmanyam in 1999, as well as the Committee of Experts set up by Ministry of Defence under the chairmanship of General D B Shekatkar

it would be a four-star military officer, who would act as the single point adviser to the government on military matters

Modern military battles cannot be fought by each service fighting independently. The present Indian Armed Forces are colonial constructs and were configured primarily to serve the interest of their colonial masters during the great wars

the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (HQIDS) was created in October 2001. But, bureaucrats succeeded in stalling the appointment of the CDS by creating the perception that it would be far easier for a CDS to stage a coup

Consequently, an anomalous situation was created wherein an organisation was created, which has been functioning without a head for the past 18 years

The appointment of the CDS will make the armed forces more effective. However, the mere creation of the office is not enough. This will need to be augmented by restructuring of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and creating integrated theatre commands

The CDS has to be a cerebral warrior with good understanding of the global security environment and functioning of the three services. It should not be a rotational appointment; the government must select one after interviewing top officials of the three services

C - the bureaucrats afraid of losing their salience will create bottlenecks. On top of that, individual services, afraid of losing their turf, are bound to resist the CDS’s involvement in their affairs

For the CDS to be effective, he must have direct access to the defence minister and through him to the prime minister

Other info - 

India has had a feeble equivalent known as the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC); but this is a toothless office, given the manner in which it is structured. The seniormost among the three Service Chiefs is appointed to head the CoSC, an office that lapses with the incumbent’s retirement

R - concentrating too much military power in the CDS’s post

R - could disrupt civil-military ties in the latter’s favour

R - each Service has its own ethos, and the Chiefs feel that under a CDS, they will be rendered virtual nonentities

R - The smaller Air Force and Navy fear that the CDS would be from the Army, by far the largest Service

R - The IAF has long argued that unlike the United States and other western militaries, the Indian Services are not an expeditionary force, for which a CDS is a necessity

R - NSA v. CDS issue might come up

# BDS - global anti-Israel movement

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement

BDS is a Palestinian-led movement that says freedom, justice, and equality are its guiding principles. 

In the 13 years since its launch, BDS is "effectively challenging international support for Israeli apartheid and settler-colonialism"

BDS describes itself as a “vibrant global movement made up of unions, academic associations, churches and grassroots movements across the world”

# PM's speech

1 - the penchant for linking everything to “one nation” — GST, common electricity grid and simultaneous elections

A - PM’s emphasis on uniformity as the underlying value is problematic, suggests a clear preference for the non-federal approach

2 - Population control

3 - ease of living -- theorised that government should be there to help but it should not cramp the citizens
