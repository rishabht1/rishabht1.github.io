# Chief of Defence Staff

better coordination between the 3 services

as recommended by both the Kargil Review Committee led by K Subrahmanyam in 1999, as well as the Committee of Experts set up by Ministry of Defence under the chairmanship of General D B Shekatkar

it would be a four-star military officer, who would act as the single point adviser to the government on military matters

Modern military battles cannot be fought by each service fighting independently. The present Indian Armed Forces are colonial constructs and were configured primarily to serve the interest of their colonial masters during the great wars

the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (HQIDS) was created in October 2001. But, bureaucrats succeeded in stalling the appointment of the CDS by creating the perception that it would be far easier for a CDS to stage a coup

Consequently, an anomalous situation was created wherein an organisation was created, which has been functioning without a head for the past 18 years

The appointment of the CDS will make the armed forces more effective. However, the mere creation of the office is not enough. This will need to be augmented by restructuring of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and creating integrated theatre commands

The CDS has to be a cerebral warrior with good understanding of the global security environment and functioning of the three services. It should not be a rotational appointment; the government must select one after interviewing top officials of the three services

C - the bureaucrats afraid of losing their salience will create bottlenecks. On top of that, individual services, afraid of losing their turf, are bound to resist the CDS’s involvement in their affairs

For the CDS to be effective, he must have direct access to the defence minister and through him to the prime minister

Other info - 

India has had a feeble equivalent known as the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC); but this is a toothless office, given the manner in which it is structured. The seniormost among the three Service Chiefs is appointed to head the CoSC, an office that lapses with the incumbent’s retirement

R - concentrating too much military power in the CDS’s post

R - could disrupt civil-military ties in the latter’s favour

R - each Service has its own ethos, and the Chiefs feel that under a CDS, they will be rendered virtual nonentities

R - The smaller Air Force and Navy fear that the CDS would be from the Army, by far the largest Service

R - The IAF has long argued that unlike the United States and other western militaries, the Indian Services are not an expeditionary force, for which a CDS is a necessity

R - NSA v. CDS issue might come up

# BDS - global anti-Israel movement

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement

BDS is a Palestinian-led movement that says freedom, justice, and equality are its guiding principles. 

In the 13 years since its launch, BDS is "effectively challenging international support for Israeli apartheid and settler-colonialism"

BDS describes itself as a “vibrant global movement made up of unions, academic associations, churches and grassroots movements across the world”

# PM's speech

1 - the penchant for linking everything to “one nation” — GST, common electricity grid and simultaneous elections

A - PM’s emphasis on uniformity as the underlying value is problematic, suggests a clear preference for the non-federal approach

2 - Population control

3 - ease of living -- theorised that government should be there to help but it should not cramp the citizens

# Jal Jeevan Mission

plans to supply water to all households by 2024

C - the institutional landscape for water at both the Centre and state government has been somewhat fragmented, with several ministries in Delhi and departments in states dealing with different aspects of water management, with overlapping roles and responsibilities

S - No single body had the ultimate oversight and authority necessary to resolve conflicting issues and take the necessary decisions. The creation of the Jal Shakti Mantralaya in the Government of India to integrate the management of India’s water resources and supply of drinking water is a landmark step in diagnosing and addressing the problem

S - The proposed Jal Jeevan Mission will make source sustainability measures mandatory prior to pumping and distributing water to households

C - Another major issue with the traditional approach to service delivery was that the provision of drinking water was viewed primarily as an engineering solution, with schemes being planned and executed by the public health and engineering departments

S - water is an ideal sector for the applicability of the principle of subsidiarity — the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level

Programmes like the Swajal project in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the WASMO programme in Gujarat, demonstrated that with adequate capacity building and training, water can be most efficiently managed at the lowest appropriate leve

C - Under the proposed Jal Jeevan Mission, with rural households planned to get household water supply, huge quantities of household waste water will be generated across the country, therefore making its effective management critical

S - It is, therefore, planned to include a mandatory provision under the Jal Jeevan Mission for the effective channeling and treatment of household waste water (known as grey water), through appropriate and low cost drainage and treatment systems

# Kannon

The Kodaiji Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan, is just 400 years old

Kannon is an android priest, with silicon skin and a camera for a left eye. It began conducting sermons earlier this year and preaches about compassion and the dangers of desire, anger and ego

Apart from the tricky theological questions, an android does provide the perfect vessel to preach detachment. When it talks of desire and ego, it can counsel without hypocrisy

The clergy at the Kodaiji temple reportedly hopes that Kannon will attract younger people, amongst whom the influence of religion is waning

# Economy and Confidence

The Reserve Bank of India’s quarterly surveys on consumer confidence, industrial outlook, households’ inflation expectations and industry’s order book, inventory and capacity utilization provide some assessment of these expectations

The RBI’s consumer confidence survey for the three months ended July 2019 indicates that households feel the economy has worsened since the previous quarter, with expectations of further worsening in the future

In such a situation, households typically postpone spending till there are clear signs of an improvement

A fresh jolt to confidence also seems to be in the offing. Bond yield curves across rich countries have started inverting, indicating that investors foresee greater stress in the near future than in the distant future

In a globally connected world, adverse economic trends travel from one geography to another through three channels: Trade, financial flows and confidence

India now has to contend with not only domestic confidence shocks—accumulated over the years through inflation, a bruised credit market leading to credit-averse financial agents, demonetization, a faulty goods and services tax structure, industry feeling victimized, direct tax uncertainty, farm income compression and rising unemployment—but also those washing up from overseas economies

S - push public sector undertakings (PSUs) for asset creation -- The government should use these funds for asset creation rather than balancing the fiscal deficit

S - direct government engagement -- A counter-cyclical fiscal policy is needed that favours expansion in times of a slowdown, but cuts back on expenditure during good times

At the heart of the logjam are amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM), introduced in 2018. These have squeezed government expenditure instead of redirecting it to productive uses

A study published in June estimated that the average human ends up consuming at least 50,000 particles of microplastics in food every year

Microplastics are either manufactured — for instance, microbeads that are used in cosmetics and beauty products — or they are formed when larger pieces of plastic break down

# Suffrage rights for women

19th Amendment - USA - 1920

one of the historic cases of pressure groups successfully and peacefully exapnding rights

The woman suffrage movement in India first gathered momentum due to female participation in the freedom struggle, beginning with the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal (1905-08), as well as support from British suffragists.

Different provinces of British India thus extended limited suffrage rights to women in the 1920’s. The Government of India Act 1935 expanded women’s suffrage, and even provided reserved seats for women in central and provincial legislatures

Full voting rights were awarded with the passing of the Indian Constitution in 1950, which provided for universal adult suffrage
