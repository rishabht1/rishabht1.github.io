# Bill to Parliamentary Committees

So far, none of the 13 bills passed by Parliament in this session have been referred to a parliamentary committee

A robust lawmaking process requires thorough scrutiny by Parliament. Such scrutiny should not be impacted by either the strength of numbers in Parliament or political agreement on issues

committees should be strengthened to scrutinise and present their reports in a timely fashion
