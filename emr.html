# Protection of Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2019

A - not just the CJI, any judge of SC can be made the chairman

Under the initial NHRC law, its two non-judge members had to be “persons having knowledge of or experience in matters relating to human rights”. The number of such members has now been raised to three including a woman member, but the imprecise provision of keeping the coveted positions open to any person of the government’s unguided choice remains unchanged

To the list of national commissions whose heads are NHRC’s ex officio members have now been added two more commissions — those for the backward classes and protection of child rights — along with the chief commissioner for persons with disabilities. The commission will thus have more adjunct than full-timer members

# East Africa and Islands

Mozambique, Madagascar and Comoros together constitute the Mozambique Channel

After the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 — which provided a shorter route from Europe to India — the salience of the South Western Indian Ocean began to diminish

That might be changing as a number of factors draw international attention to the Mozambique Channel in the 21st century

The rise of China and East Asia as well as the slower emergence of India have deepened economic interdependence between Asia, the Middle East and Africa

Access to critically located islands has always been an important part of the maritime jousting between great powers

3 island chains -- India v. China

# PPP

explore the lessons from the UK, the pioneer in the use of PPPs and privatisation in infrastructure

sewage, water, railways, health

The starting point in India may often be a public agency which is inefficient, corrupt at the point of contact with the citizen and providing very poor service. With a much lower starting point, it is quite conceivable that private providers may be operationally more efficient and give better service. To that extent, the case for PPP is stronger in India than in the UK.

PPP must not be a short cut only to save money or bridge fiscal gaps or transfer risks; it should be used to improve service quality or bring efficiency improvements. 

Clear principles and a mechanism for renegotiations without moral hazard need to be planned for

# Tiger Population

around 3000, increase of 33% from the 2014 figures

India -- 70% of tiger population -- responsibility to save the species

Factors -- measures taken to combat organized poachers, the deployment of a special tiger force, an increase in tiger habitat areas, and the relocation of villages away from tiger reserves

Under the current green cover, habitats reach tiger-saturation points far too early. If tigers are to survive, they need free space—and lots of it.

# Growth and Inclusivity

India has hitherto grown unevenly, with some regions contributing to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) much more than others

Such a development model driven by deep pockets of growth is neither environmentally sustainable nor inclusive. It puts disproportionate pressure on a fast-growing region’s infrastructure and resource

Oxford Economics predicts that all the top 10 fastest-growing cities in the world for the next 15 years are going to be in India. Surat tops this list

Surat -- not inclusive -- Decent working conditions are absent. Profits are reinvested or retained on the pretext of wafer-thin margins, and workers have negligible opportunities to partake in the region’s growth

Bangalore -- worst water crisis

It is no surprise that none of the Indian cities features in the top 80 of the Sustainable Cities Index, which ranks cities on the parameters of “people, planet and profit".

Our work on documenting traditional sustainable and scalable business practices in India took us to remote corners of the country

sustainable, economic and human empowerment need to be coupled with political empowerment. Citizens need to work with governments and bureaucrats more closely to set performance targets and fix accountability in case of non-performance
