# Constitutionalism

Constitutionalism tries to limit the power of constitutional authorities through doctrines such as rule of law which, as opposed to rule by law, ensures equality before law, equal protection of laws to all and non-arbitrary exercise of power

Constitutionalism is the anti-thesis of authoritarianism. Having a constitution does not mean that we have constitutionalism as well

Several communist and Islamic countries had constitutions without constitutionalism. Hitler, too, had the Weimar Constitution

As the people’s representatives too may go against the Constitution, we have given the power of judicial review to constitutional courts to strike down a law if it violates the constitution and a constitutional amendment if it impinges on its “basic structure”

# Kuznets curve and India

hypothesizes that as an economy develops, income inequality first increases and then begins to reduce

India appears to be in the former phase

the basis of the Kuznets curve has been criticized for holding out hope without adequate justification. In other words, our policymakers cannot afford to be complacent

The rise in inequality occurs after rural labor migrates to urban areas and becomes socially mobile. After a certain income level is reached, inequality declines as a welfare state takes hold

A modification of the curve, known as environmental Kuznets curve, has become popular to chart the rise and decline of pollution in an industrializing nation's economy

Not based on empirical evidence -- UK, France

# Negative Interest Rates

Pros - lowered borrowing rates

P - help weaken a country’s currency rate by making it a less attractive investment than that of other currencies. A weaker currency gives a country’s export a competitive advantage and boosts inflation by pushing up import costs

C - put downward pressure on the entire yield curve and narrow the margin financial institutions earn from lending

C - If prolonged ultra-low rates hurt the health of financial institutions too much, they could hold off on lending and damage the economy

C - There are also limits to how deep central banks can push rates into negative territory – depositors can avoid being charged negative rates on their bank deposits by choosing to hold physical cash instead
