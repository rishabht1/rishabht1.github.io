# Sovereign Bonds -- Criticism

could prove addictive

India’s sovereign external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is among the lowest globally at less than 5%

consequences could be disastrous in the long run

almost all macroeconomic crises in emerging economies emanated from issues relating to foreign exchange

the Asian crisis of the late 1990s originated with unsustainable foreign currency debts, as have most macroeconomic crises in Latin America and Africa

Apart from 1991, which was a singular episode, triggered by the spike in oil prices and the collapse of remittances from workers abroad following the first Gulf War, India has been largely immune from major macroeconomic disturbances emanating from overseas.

# CAG audit report on indirect taxes

Implementation glitches, compliance burden has not gone down, revenue collections have not met expectations

Invoice matching is still not operational

system is prone to input tax credit (ITC) frauds

ITC means deducting the tax paid on inputs from the tax payable on the final output 

the manner in which the government devolved Rs 67,998 crore under integrated GST to states was “against the provisions of Constitution of India.”

lack of co-ordination between stakeholders

failure to test the systems before rolling them out

# Corporate Social Responsibility

companies have a social responsibility, but it is not to engage in philanthropy

their fundamental social responsibility is to generate wealth for their shareholders in a law-abiding, ethical and sustainable way. When they do that, they generate surpluses for society, provide consumers with goods and services that they need, create employment, purpose and dignity among workers, and strengthen the nation

The government can encourage this—through tax deductions, public acclamation and moral suasion—but has no business intervening in those decisions

forced expropriation of unspent funds and the introduction of jail terms for non-compliance is terrible

# Dam Safety Bill

The NCDS is to formulate policies for dam safety and to prevent dam failures. In the event of a dam failure, the NCDS will analyse why the failure occurred, and suggest changes in dam safety practices to ensure there aren’t any repetitions

# Triple Talaq

473 cases in last 2 years -- after the SC judgement

the incidence of triple divorce is negligible and the issue was blown out of proportion for political reasons

the penal provision in the ordinance had no deterrent effect

there is a distinction between an act being declared “invalid” and being made an “offence”. The Supreme Court declared triple divorce as invalid and did not ask the government to make it a penal offence

Every punishment which does not arise from absolute necessity, according to Montesquieu, is tyrannical. In fact, criminal law should be used only as a “last resort” (ultima ratio) and only for the “most reprehensible wrongs”

Argument -- TT is a 'sin' under Islamic law -- hence it can be penalised -- Are we going in the direction of religious theocracy?

criminal law reflects the idea of “power” rather than “justice”

---

Claim -- it is a bailable offence. Reality -- judge's discretion

Bound to fail in oral divorces -- when no one other than the couple is present -- burden of proof

We are doing a huge disservice to Muslim women as no husband on his return from jail is likely to retain the wife on whose complaint he had gone to prison -- The Bill will lead to more divorces and abandonment

remedy to tackle triple divorce is thus worse than the disease

Three years’ imprisonment in the new Bill is excessive and is disproportionate. The Indian Penal Code provides far lesser sentences for graver crimes. The TTB obliterates the distinction between “minor” and “major” crimes

# Farming and Solar Evergy

why the annadata (farmer) cannot become the urjadata (producer of solar power)

doubling farmer's income + target of 100GW solar power by 2022

farmers occupy the largest chunks of land in this country. This model will be much more inclusive and can help augment their incomes significantly

Two variants --

Replace all pumpsets with solar pumps -- excess power could be brought by the state govts

encourage farmers to grow “solar trees” on their lands at a height of about 10-12 feet in a manner that enough sunlight keeps coming to plants below

Power generated in the second type is multiple times more than the previous one

# Kashmir and Northwest -- C Raja Mohan

Until now, the Taliban has insisted that the US must withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan. The US, on the other hand, wants to leave a small force to execute counter-terror missions. Pakistan is expected to nudge the Taliban into accepting a phased withdrawal of American troops

Delhi has also got better at navigating the triangular dynamic with Pakistan and the United States

Delhi has also become adept at turning the crises with Pakistan to focus less on Kashmir and more on the sources of terrorism originating from Pakistani soil

The biggest change, however, is the decision in Delhi to stop being defensive on Pakistan and Kashmir. We have seen so in the response of the Modi government to the terror attacks at Uri in 2016 and Pulwama in 2019

#Competittion Policy and Changing Business Environment

Competition Act of 2002 -- establishes the Competition Commission as the arbiter of any activities that may have an “adverse effect on competition in India"

The Act is now inadequate to deal with the changing business environment in telecommunications, technology and e-commerce, and the government’s own role in distorting competition

consumer data and behaviour is the “asset" around which a monopoly or an oligopoly can exist

Private corporations or the government can abuse this asset by monopolizing it to deliver a range of goods and services

A government may abuse its power to regulate by preferring large domestic corporations over foreign ones, or by interfering in pricing

In India, you are beginning to see emerging corporate concentrations in consumer industries related to data and e-commerce and payments

class: center

on one hand, creating the only truly interoperable backbone in the world for payments (the Unified Payments Interface)

on the other interfering directly in the payments industry by abolishing the merchant discount rate, and promoting a government-created consumer app called Bhim

The long-standing Indian interference tradition has led to landmark interventions that include the nationalization of banks (1969), abolishment of front-end loads for mutual fund sales (2009) and the wide-spread subsidy for LPG sales

WF - 

updated competition policy in India must simultaneously focus on the objectives of free and fair competition, consumer welfare and the abuse of monopoly power wielded by government and companies

The Competition Commission must have the authority (and the will) to investigate and charge the government with “distortion of competition" if it interferes micro-economically with pricing or arbitrarily favours private companies with regulation

# Difficult to enforce legislations

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, Code on Wages, Companies (Amendment) Bill (CSR)

should Parliament pass laws that the government cannot enforce?

Y - better to have these strong laws on the books, as the prospect of severe punishment can be used to deter individuals from breaking rules

Y - As India develops more state capacity in the future, these laws will be primed for better enforcement

Y? - this view does not take into account the kind of incentives created by under-enforcement and its unintended consequences

N - low capacity to enforce leads to arbitrary enforcement. So, some individuals will get away while others will be punished. This tends not to be random. Typically, rich and politically well-connected individuals get away. Opposition is targeted for selective enforcement.

---

class: center

N - a rule violator weighs the expected costs and benefits of breaking a rule

N - One simple way by which more crime occurs in society is criminalizing more activities. To deter certain actions by criminalizing them increases the amount of crime in society and reduces the probability of being punished -- enforcement resources are constrained

N - even sensibly crafted pre-existing laws that were enforced to some degree will now be enforced to a less degree because of overloading of the enforcement infrastructure

WF - stop passing laws that simply overload the system and cannot be enforced

WF - focus on infrastructure and capacity building

WF - third step is to free up existing state capacity by reducing or repealing onerous regulations in almost every area of social and economic conduct -- streamlining and simplification

# Currency Manipulation

Exchange Rate determination -- ideally, determined by the interplay of its demand and supply. If more Indians want to buy US goods, there would be a higher demand for the dollar relative to the rupee

Most governments and central banks are bothered about generating more growth and employment at home. A weaker domestic currency comes in very handy when governments are trying to attract foreign demand and boost exports.

China’s economic growth has been essentially fuelled by exporting to the world

if China’s central bank buys dollars in the forex market, it can artificially weaken the yuan — and Chinese goods will then become more affordable (and competitive) in the international market

what makes the Chinese phone cheaper? If it is the case that China is more efficient at making the phone, then nobody can complain. But if China is artificially reducing the “price” of its currency — by devaluing the yuan relative to the dollar or the rupee — it will be accused of manipulating its currency

# Economic v Political integration

Europe -- EU

Historically, Most of the large business groups in Inida had only a regional presence

The manifold failures of the Indian public sector are common knowledge. But it also created the managers, scientists, technicians, administrators and bankers who once formed the backbone of the Indian middle class. The public sector was thus an important driver of economic integration

The end of the special status for Kashmir is part of a political project—and will largely be seen through that prism. However, the political project will flounder unless it brings economic opportunity in its wake

# Central Bank Independence - R. Rajan

In theory, central bank independence means that monetary policymakers have the freedom to make unpopular but necessary decisions, particularly when it comes to combating inflation and financial excesses, because they do not have to stand for election

This arrangement gives investors more confidence in a country’s monetary and financial stability

Made scapegoats -- 2008 crisis

A central bank’s mandate requires it to ease monetary policy when growth is flagging, even when the government’s own policies are the problem

populist leaders may mistakenly believe the central bank can do more to rescue the economy from their policy mistakes than it actually can deliver

Gadkari’s raft of proposals include steep increases in punishment for violators of traffic rules, penalties for builders of unsafe roads, an automated system of licencing to do away with human examiners (and presumably the chances of corruption), cashless treatment of accident victims and hikes in compensation

Other view -- rise in punishment prize (fine or bribes) will make people follow rules

# New Report by IPCC

presents the most recent evidence on how the different uses of land — forests, agriculture, urbanisation — are affecting and getting affected by climate change

__Land-Climate__ -- 

land acts as both the source as well as a sink of carbon

Activities like agriculture and cattle rearing, for example, are a major source of methane and nitrous oxide, both of which are hundreds of times more dangerous than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas

largescale land use changes, like deforestation or urbanisation, or even a change in cropping pattern, have a direct impact on the overall emissions of greenhouse gases

The report says that if pre-production activities like cattle rearing and post-production activities like transport, energy and food processing, is taken into account, then food production could contribute as much as 37 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions every year.

---

class: center

It points out that nearly 25 per cent of all food produced is either lost or wasted. And even the decomposition of the waste releases emissions.

afforestation, and reduction in deforestation, are vital approaches in a global strategy to combat climate change

India’s action plan on climate change too, has a very important component on forests. India has promised that it would create an additional carbon sink of about 2.5 billion to 3 billion tonnes by the year 2032 by increasing its forest cover, and planting more trees
