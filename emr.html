# Polygraph and Narcoanalysis

Polygraph -  based on the assumption that physiological responses that are triggered when a person is lying are different from what they would be otherwise

Instruments like cardio-cuffs or sensitive electrodes are attached to the person, and variables such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, change in sweat gland activity, blood flow, etc., are measured as questions are put to them. 

Narcoanalysis - involves the injection of a drug, sodium pentothal, which induces a hypnotic or sedated state in which the subject’s imagination is neutralised, and they are expected to divulge true information -- “truth serum”

India -- no lie detector tests should be administered “except on the basis of consent of the accused”

Those who volunteer must have access to a lawyer, and have the physical, emotional, and legal implications of the test explained to them by police and the lawyer,

---

class: center

The results of the tests cannot be considered to be “confessions”, because those in a drugged-induced state cannot exercise a choice in answering questions that are put to them.

However, any information or material subsequently discovered with the help of such a voluntarily-taken test can be admitted as evidence

# Governement Bailouts

K Subramanian, CEA -- bailouts amounts to socializing losses, and privatizing profits

The US government in 2009-09 had then unveiled a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to fund with taxpayer money the rescue of large financial services companies, some of them deemed “too big to fail"

bailouts go against the principles of free-market competition. They perversely reward poor business risk management at the cost of taxpayers, thus setting up a moral hazard—since businesses would be less likely to fear and mitigate their risks if they expect to be bailed out.

Are Indian private companies also getting overly dependent on public support? This is not clear, since many of them are merely asking the government to eliminate obstacles, rather than render financial help. 

So long as they seek reforms that allow market forces to operate freely, they should not be faulted

# Beijing and Kashmir

Despite the isolation of China at the UNSC, the message to India was clear: Beijing would join forces with Pakistan to hurt Indian interests at every possible forum

There were many in India who, rather unreasonably, expected China to moderate its behaviour vis-à-vis India in light of the so-called “Wuhan spirit".

By backing Pakistan’s request for the UNSC to discuss India’s latest move, China has signalled its priorities and made any normalization of ties almost impossible.

China’s response is also driven by its wider interests as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has pushed China to be even more aggressive on Kashmir

With China reportedly planning to set up a permanent military base in Pakistan for CPEC, India should be prepared for greater Chinese meddling on this matter

---

class: center

India’s deft diplomatic handling of the situation has ensured that China stands isolated at the UN. This has been happening repeatedly now. Earlier this year, China was isolated while trying to protect Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist, but had to later backtrack in the face of global opinion

as India becomes a more proactive player in the international order and China’s troubles with the rest of the world continue to grow, Beijing will target New Delhi even more pointedly

China can’t expect that its priorities on trade and 5G would be considered favourably by India if it continues to challenge the fundamentals of good neighbourly ties

If China is so aggressive on Kashmir, then nothing stops India from raking up issues like Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Tibet and Taiwan remain Chinese vulnerabilities

It should realize that there is no major constituency left in India today that has a favourable view of China

If China has a long-term strategy of containing India within South Asia, then India can just as easily adopt a strategy of challenging China’s core interests

1 - enhancing bilateral cooperation in strategic sectors. France has always been an important partner in the development of advanced technologies. This is set to advance further with the consolidation of civil nuclear cooperation and enhancing space cooperation

2 - the new commitment to go beyond the buyer-seller relationship in the field of weapons procurement. When India comes up with clear policies for making arms in India, the synergies between India’s large defence market and the French strengths in armament production would come into full play

3 - political cooperation between India and France is relatively new; it began with French support for India in limiting international sanctions on Delhi after its 1998 nuclear tests. Today, France has emerged as India’s most reliable partner on issues relating to terrorism and Kashmir.

4 - the relationship between India and France has gone beyond the bilateral to focus on the regional. Modi and Macron this week have agreed to intensify maritime and naval cooperation in the Indian Ocean and more broadly the Indo-Pacific

# Democratic Values

Democracy is not just a set of institutions but also a set of values

Democratic values include the ability to accommodate a diverse range of viewpoints that requires civility of conduct, a commitment to egalitarian ideals, the idea of universal citizenship — encompassing rights but also duties, allowing all sections of the populace to be heard despite the louder voice of the majority, and, a general commitment to the common good over individual desires. 

The relationship between democratic institutions and democratic values is symbiotic: The former are there to safeguard the latter and to exemplify them in their own conduct.

In turn, the foremost democratic value is respect for institutions

# Indentured Labourers

The migration of indentured labour—bonded labour—is a lesser known part of the history of slavery and that of Indian migration

International Day for Remembrance of the Slave Trade and Abolition -- UNESCO -- 1998

Indentured servitude from India started in 1834 and lasted up till 1922, despite having been officially banned in 1917 by British India’s Imperial Legislative Council after pressure from freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi

In Europe in the 1820s, there was a new kind of liberal humanism where slavery was considered inhuman -- It was following this ideology that the colonisers stopped slavery in India, only to replace it with another form of bonded servitude and euphemistically term it ‘indentured labour’

This practice of indentured labour resulted in the growth of a large diaspora with Indo-Carribean, Indo-African and Indo-Malaysian heritage that continue to live in the Carribean, Fiji, Réunion, Natal, Mauritius, Malaysia, Sri Lanka etc.

indentured migration started post the abolition of slavery to run sugar and rubber plantations that the British had set up in the West Indies

---

class: center

The British Empire was expanding to South America, Africa and Asia and they needed new labour, but slavery was considered inhuman. So they developed the concept of contract labour,

The British turned to India and China that had a large population and found the surplus labour they needed to run these plantations in the new colonies

After ruining the agriculture business in India, they exploited the mass unemployment that had hit small farmers the hardest

They were poor farmers and the indenture lasted for 10 years. They were paid monthly wages and were living on the plantations in these colonies

Initially, single men were selected for indenture but the British Parliament decided to encourage family migration to provide “stability”

The British attempted to disassociate indentured labour from slavery by calling it an “agreement” when recruiting Indians who would be willing to migrate, to try and hide the true nature of the practice

---

class: center

Why Slavery?

Most aspiring migrants were misled about the work they would have to engage in, the wages they would receive, the living conditions and the places they were travelling to

The system subjected poor, vulnerable Indians to long-term abuse and exploitation and the pain of these indentured migrants has been recorded through music, books, photographs and other forms of literature

The journey by sea was long and traumatic, with travel taking approximately 160 days to reach the Caribbean colonies. The comfort of the migrants was not even a consideration for the British and the travellers were loaded onto cargo cargo ships that were not meant to carry passengers

Many migrants were forced to sit on open decks that left them vulnerable to direct, harsh weather at sea. Sanitation was poor and there was little access to food and medication. These conditions were particularly difficult for small children and there was high mortality. Those who died on board were simply thrown off the ships into the sea

The migrants also faced physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the European ship captains and there was no means of escape except jumping off the ship into the water

---

class: center

The migrants took their culture with them through their language, food and music and the meagre belongings that they were permitted to carry. Once they reached these colonies, they created their unique socio-cultural ecosystems while they were limited to living in the confines of these large plantations

500,000 people migrated to Malaysia to work on plantations where many died of snake bites, hunger, diarrhea but no authorities paid attention to the difficulties that migrants faced in these colonies

Some migrants came back from colonies in East Africa but were not welcome. Their families had forgotten them and there was a cultural gap that had resulted due to the years the migrants had spent overseas

For some others, however, the cultural stigma of having a significant amount of time overseas and untouchability associated with the journey, resulted in a denial of acceptance once they returned to India

# Gravitational Lensing

first predicted by Einstein

The phenomenon occurs when a huge amount of matter, such as a massive galaxy or cluster of galaxies, creates a gravitational field that distorts and magnifies the light from objects behind it, but in the same line of sight

these are natural, cosmic telescopes; they are called gravitational lenses. These large celestial objects will magnify the light from distant galaxies that are at or near the peak of star formation

The effect allows researchers to study the details of early galaxies too far away to be seen otherwise with even the most powerful space telescopes

# Asia Rising (PSIR)

cats (Asian countries) and monkeys (West)

Not long back, a Chinese premier said to his Indian counterpart that when India and China shake hands the whole world looks at them. What was not stated was that some would look with hope and others with concern

Lee Kuan Yew, founder-mentor of Singapore, famously said that China and India were the twin engines of the Asian aircraft and that together the two engines would lift the continent as a whole onto a new trajectory of growth

“differences turning into disputes”, not just between the two Asian giants but between so many Asian neighbours, could ground the Asian aircraft and delay the dawn of the so-called “Asian century”?

It is no secret that the US is now engaged in a “geo-economic containment” of China, as originally theorised by the Harvard scholar Edward Luttwak in his wonderfully crafted book, The Rise of China and the Logic of Conflict (2012). Of course, the Chinese understand this

---

class: center

Major Asian powers have a responsibility towards the continent as a whole. No power, howsoever big and powerful, can hope to dominate the continent. Asia will never become China’s backyard the way the US converted western Europe into its backyard after the Second World War

Sanjay Baru -  If the US succeeds in the “geo-economic containment” of China it will be because of China’s inability to reassure its neighbours rather then because Asians will once again wish to be dominated by the West

The real and present challenge for all of Asia is the slowing down of its growth engines. Sure, the global growth engine is itself slowing down, but for most Asian countries the slowdown threatens livelihoods, not merely lifestyles

For India, the slowdown is even more challenging since it is now clear that it is not merely a cyclical downturn that can be addressed with fiscal and monetary policy intervention but has deep-rooted structural foundations that need urgent fixing

Analysts have pointed to inadequate improvement in labour productivity, reduced rates of saving and investment, inadequate demand constrained by inequalities in wealth and income as structural factors that are holding the Indian economy back

---

class: center

Given global demographics and income distribution, any hope of restoring momentum to global growth depends vitally on the Asian growth process rebounding

But, for growth to return to Asia, the continent needs geopolitical stability. Asia cannot look to the West for a return to such stability for a variety of reasons. Europe is constrained by a lack of vision and capability while the US is actively engaged in disrupting global growth to ensure its own continued dominance

Luttwak’s advice for the US leadership was to seek the geo-economic containment of China. However, President Donald Trump has acted as if he is seeking the geo-economic containment of Asia as a whole

Against this background, Asian leaderships across the continent have a responsibility to the future

# Mappila Rebellion - G1

The Mappilas were landless Muslims at the lowest rung of the social ladder, living at the mercy of Hindu landlords appointed by the British as their agents

As their numbers increased due to demographic growth and the conversion of many low-caste Hindus, the Mappilas launched an armed rebellion against the British and upper-caste Hindus

The six months of rioting in 1921 led to the loss of about 10,000 lives, out of which some 2,339 were rebels

Some consider it to be one of the first nationalist uprisings of Southern India; others have studied whether the revolt was peasant-led, directed against British authorities, or guided by religious impulses

Broadly, however, the rebellion of the Mappilas is seen as a struggle against British political power that happened to take a communal colour

As the British moved in to crush the revolt, many Mappilas fled to Mumbai and onward to Karachi, which was at the time possible to reach by train

It is believed that fewer than 6,000 of Mappilas live in Karachi today

# Amazon Fire - G3

Oxygen supply at risk? -- No. While it’s commonly said that the Amazon produces 20% of the world’s oxygen, climate scientists say that figure is wrong and the oxygen supply is not directly at risk in any case. That’s because forests, including the Amazon, absorb roughly the same amount of oxygen they produce. Plants do produce oxygen through photosynthesis, but they also absorb it to grow, as do animals and microbes.

Impact will be on absorption of CO2 -- a better way to picture the Amazon’s role is as a sink, draining heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

The Amazon absorbs 2 billion tons of CO2 per year (or 5% of annual emissions), making it a vital part of preventing climate change.

The rainforest recycles its own water to produce a portion of the region’s rain, so deforestation makes rains less frequent, extending the dry season -- if 20% to 25% of the forest is destroyed, the dry season will expand enough that it will no longer be a forest, but a savannah

# NRC - G2

The updating of the NRC—India’s largest ever judiciary-led bureaucratic operation — has taken most of its energy and attention

Originally, SC had said -- "While taking note of the existing mechanism/procedure for deportation keeping in view the requirements of international protocol, we direct the Union of India to enter into necessary discussions with the Government of Bangladesh to streamline the procedure of deportation"

India’s diplomatic priorities vis-à-vis Bangladesh are simply much too high to risk alienating that country by deporting its nationals. The Modi government has clearly made a decision that the question of unauthorised immigrants is best left as India’s internal matter.

There are no signs that a general amnesty will be among the options that India will consider. But defining hundreds and thousands of people living in the country as non-citizens will create a new form of precarious citizenship — people with fewer rights and entitlements

This is an uncharted and potentially dangerous territory for a democracy. The growing talk of detention camps and the rapid normalisation of the idea does not bode well.

# Ind - Ban in lieu of NRC - G2

A World Bank publication from 2016 listed the Bangladesh-India “migration corridor" as the busiest after Mexico-United States and Ukraine-Russia

Bangladesh. India shares a 4,000-km-plus border with Bangladesh, along West Bengal (which accounts for more than half), Assam (the least, after Mizoram), Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. Some of the border is riverine, and impossible to fence. Even with fenced aspects, the border is permeable

India’s deputy home minister told parliament in November 2016 that an estimated 20 million Bangladeshi immigrants were illegally staying in India

a former chief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of the Cabinet Secretariat, admitted there were no reliable figures or exact numbers of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh in India

There’s no acknowledgement of remittances from India in data from Bangladesh Bank

An Indian fishing vessel desirous of fishing in the EEZ, outside the TS, must obtain a permit -- There is a faulty assumption in the Bill that only large-scale vessels fish outside the TS. Actually, thousands of small-scale fishing crafts regularly venture into such areas. Their freedom to access fish outside the TS will cease if the Bill becomes law

Bigger vessels, particularly trawlers, registered and licenced under state departments,  will need a permit to fish. This is a welcome measure to manage the fishing sector

It proposes social security for fish workers and calls for protection of life at sea during severe weather events

WF - Cooperative governance between them over different territories (IW, TS and EEZ) is key to the sustainable management of marine fisheries, which should now ideally go into the Concurrent List 

WF - Small-scale fish workers should demand making the entire IW and TS completely free of trawling  using the FAO/UN Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines to support their arguments. This will raise their incomes, ensure a steady supply to consumers, heal the coastal areas and curb the bane of destructive fishing
