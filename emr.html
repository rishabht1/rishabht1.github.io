# Constitutionalism

Constitutionalism tries to limit the power of constitutional authorities through doctrines such as rule of law which, as opposed to rule by law, ensures equality before law, equal protection of laws to all and non-arbitrary exercise of power

Constitutionalism is the anti-thesis of authoritarianism. Having a constitution does not mean that we have constitutionalism as well

Several communist and Islamic countries had constitutions without constitutionalism. Hitler, too, had the Weimar Constitution

As the people’s representatives too may go against the Constitution, we have given the power of judicial review to constitutional courts to strike down a law if it violates the constitution and a constitutional amendment if it impinges on its “basic structure”

# Kuznets curve and India

hypothesizes that as an economy develops, income inequality first increases and then begins to reduce

India appears to be in the former phase

the basis of the Kuznets curve has been criticized for holding out hope without adequate justification. In other words, our policymakers cannot afford to be complacent

The rise in inequality occurs after rural labor migrates to urban areas and becomes socially mobile. After a certain income level is reached, inequality declines as a welfare state takes hold

A modification of the curve, known as environmental Kuznets curve, has become popular to chart the rise and decline of pollution in an industrializing nation's economy

Not based on empirical evidence -- UK, France

# Rainfall and Floods

2018 - esult of heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of reservoirs and the subsequent opening of dam shutters to drain out excess water into rivers

2019 - more ‘localised’ - High-intensity rainfall in low-lying areas and villages located in the Western Ghats led to waterlogging and landslides

# Negative Interest Rates

Pros - lowered borrowing rates

P - help weaken a country’s currency rate by making it a less attractive investment than that of other currencies. A weaker currency gives a country’s export a competitive advantage and boosts inflation by pushing up import costs

C - put downward pressure on the entire yield curve and narrow the margin financial institutions earn from lending

C - If prolonged ultra-low rates hurt the health of financial institutions too much, they could hold off on lending and damage the economy

C - There are also limits to how deep central banks can push rates into negative territory – depositors can avoid being charged negative rates on their bank deposits by choosing to hold physical cash instead

# Legal rights for rivers

Uttarakhand HC -- on stay by SC

Australia and NZ

declared as juristic/legal persons/living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person in order to preserve and conserve river Ganga and Yamuna

Granting legal rights to rivers (and water-bodies) opens up a new area of environmental jurisprudence

# Water crisis

Reducing its use in agriculture is the most effective way of solving India’s water problem.

The single largest fact about India’s water is that 90 per cent of it is consumed in farming. And that 80 per cent of this irrigation is for water-guzzling crops — rice, wheat and sugarcane

But can we do this without hurting our farmers, who are already in so much distress? Yes, we can. Indeed, it turns out that the solutions to India’s water crisis and that of the farmers, lie in the very same direction

If we diversify our procurement operations, to include less water-intensive crops, like millets, pulses and oilseeds, especially in India’s drylands, farmers would have the incentive to grow them

Introduce them in the mid-day meal scheme and the integrated child development services, which are the largest child nutrition programmes in human history

Improvement in soil and water quality, higher and more stable net incomes for farmers, reduced malnutrition and obesity, and a simple solution to India’s water problem through a huge reduction in the use of water in agriculture

class: center

if our children were to eat these “nutri-cereals” with much higher protein, iron and fibre, with a significantly lower glycemic index, we would be better placed to solve our twin problems of malnutrition and obesity

Allied to this paradigm shift in farming, we need to democratise water. Water, by its very nature, is a shared resource, which can only be nourished through participatory governance

# Skilling next gen

Half-life of skills

Integration -- A great deal of innovation is occurring at the interfaces of fields. For example, while mathematics and geography are taught in silos today, the opportunity lies in using mathematics and geography together. Geolocation, geofenced advertisement, maps, GPS, and other similar technologies are all about precisely that intersection: mathematics and geography

New challenges -- the jobs and lives of the future pose new and difficult questions of ethics and purpose. For example, we have seen the recent controversy around employees of a food-ordering app refusing to deliver certain types of non-vegetarian food, and the complex ethical questions surrounding it

# Yield curve, inverse yield curve

Plots yield of bonds and maturity

Normal -- A normal or up-sloped yield curve indicates yields on longer-term bonds may continue to rise, responding to periods of economic expansion.

Inverted -- An inverted or down-sloped yield curve suggests yields on longer-term bonds may continue to fall, corresponding to periods of economic recession.

an inverted yield curve does not always signal a sharply slowing economy. Many inversions in the past have been benign

# Principles of selecting IoE

no existing institution which has not figured in any of the global/national ranks shall be recommended

only after exhausting the above criterion, if any slot remains vacant, consideration will be given to yet to be established (greenfield) proposals

private institutions -- no financial support -- more autonomy as special category deemed universities

public -- 1000 cr over 5 years

greenfield -- 3 years to establish and operationalise
