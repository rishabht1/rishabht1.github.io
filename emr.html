# IPCC Report number 3 - G3

On Oceans and Cryosphere

The new ocean report noted that the global mean sea level had risen by 16 cm between 1902 and 2015, and that the rate of increase had doubled in the last one decade.

The sea levels were rising because of thermal expansion of ocean waters due to rising temperatures as well as due to melting of glaciers and polar ice.

It says that between 2006 and 2015, the Greenland ice sheet lost ice-mass at an average rate of 278 billion tonnes every year, while the Antarctic ice sheet lost a mass of 155 billion tonnes on an average every year.

Snow over areas outside of these two regions, like the glaciers in the Himalayas, together lost an average of 220 billion tonnes of ice every year.

# Waste Management - G3

circular economy (CE) modelthat seeks to restore and regenerate, and also reduce waste by replacing the end-of-life concept

Reduced waste generation through closing the loop using CE and resource efficiency (RE) approaches will not only reduce pollution associated with waste disposal but also save related costs in resolving the short-term trade-offs between growth and environmental sustainability towards enhancing the overall security of human beings.

National Resource Efficiency Policy (NREP), 2019 is guided by few key principles namely, reduction in primary resource consumption to ‘sustainable’ levels, in keeping with achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and staying within the planetary boundaries; creation of higher value with less material through resource efficient and circular approaches; waste minimization; material security and creation of employment opportunities, and business models beneficial to the cause of environment protection and restoration.

# Automobiles - G3

It’s shocking that India is absent from global value chains despite being a major car producer

finished passenger automobiles—have been characterized by very high import tariffs that are anywhere from 60% to as high as 125% in some cases, making India one of the highest import tariff jurisdictions in this sector among major economies

The more important consequence of high protective tariffs is that Indian automobile makers are characterized by low productivity, as compared to other comparable car-producing countries.

Due to low productivity and an inefficiently low scale of production, in general, Indian automobiles are uncompetitive in the global market. It is a telling fact that a country which is the sixth largest automobile manufacturer in the world has barely 1% of global exports, and is largely absent from well-established global value chains (GVCs).

It is noteworthy that the automobile parts industry, which has faced low tariffs (as low as 12.5%) and has been largely deregulated, has been characterized by higher productivity and much better export performance than the completely-built-units sector in the years since liberalization.

# Deficit Spending - G3

So long as the country’s demography is such that more beneficiaries are expected to be born than there are today, the per capita burden of today’s deficit-spending will be lower tomorrow.

For, if a bridge or airport is financed through a deficit today, it is a public good that will last for more than 50 years and whose benefits will be enjoyed by multiple generations.

Japan has the world’s highest debt-to-GDP ratio, at close to 350%. But its debt is still AAA-rated and nobody has said it is unsustainable, even though its demography is unfavourable because its population is shrinking.

The per capita burden of servicing that debt will keep rising for future Japanese generations. One big point in their favour is that most of the debt is held internally. It is like the left pocket owing money to the right. Another favourable point is its near-zero interest rate on sovereign debt.

In the US, which runs the highest deficit in the world (close to $1 trillion), the big point is that all its debt is in a currency that it can print. So it can earn unlimited seigniorage, inflate and thus erode the real value of its debt. Moreover, the world seems to have an insatiable hunger for US sovereign bonds, so financing the debt seems like a cakewalk.

India should deepen its economic linkages with Saudi Arabia through interlocking cross country investments

How vulnerable are our oil and gas assets on the western coast? Specifically, the Mumbai High oil and gas fields, the Jamnagar refinery complex and the LNG regassification terminals in Dahej, Hazira, Dabhol and Cochin

Pakistan is heavily in debt to Saudi Arabia and it depends hugely on the kingdom’s largesse to avoid economic collapse. Saudi Arabia has consequently considerable leverage over Pakistan and the latter in turn cannot afford to ignore Saudi economic interests when war gaming an offensive strategy against India.

Were the Saudis invested in India oil and gas assets, it might deter Pakistan from bringing these assets into their strategic calculus.

# Gandhi's Minimalism

For Gandhi, minimalism was not a tool to find freedom. Minimalism was an end in itself and arose out of the ethical obligations to the “other”, which included fellow humans, animals and nature.

In this framework, freedom is achieved not in realising our best self but is implicit in those actions that recognise and respond to the other, especially the weak and the powerless

Gandhi’s minimalism thus traverses a complex ethical web. It calls for intentional living by being conscious and considerate of the diverse and varied relationships we maintain with our own surroundings. 

It is not the passion of the self that is at the forefront of this minimalism but our responsibility towards the other. It is in this vein that Gandhi asks us to be “trustees” of this planet, not its owner.

# States and GDP

Reserve Bank of India released its annual study of state-level budgets

states now spend one-and-a-half times more than the Union government and, in doing so, they employ five times more people than the Centre

not only do states have a greater role to play in determining India’s GDP than the Centre, they are also the bigger employment generators

As such, it is crucial to understand their spending pattern. If, for example, their combined expenditure contracts from one year to the other, then it will bring down India’s GDP.

since 2014-15, states have increasingly borrowed money from the market — a trend captured in the fiscal deficit figure. In fact, their total borrowing almost rivals the borrowing by the Union government. This trend, too, has serious implications on the interest rates charged in the economy, the availability of funds for businesses to invest in new factories, and the ability of the private sector to employ new labour.

# La Nina, IOD, Intertropical Convergence Zone - P/G1

La Niña, the phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean in which the sea surface temperatures turn unusually cold, is known to strengthen rainfall over the Indian sub-continent during the monsoon months.

The IOD is a phenomenon similar to the ENSO condition observed in the Pacific Ocean which creates the El Niño and La Niña events. The sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean get warmer and cooler than normal, and this deviation influences regional atmospheric and weather patterns, notably the Indian monsoon.

While the Pacific Ocean only has an El Niño or a La Niña condition at a time, the Indian Ocean experiences both warm and cold conditions at the same time – hence, a dipole.

One of these poles is located in the Arabian Sea, while the other is in the Indian Ocean, south of Indonesia.

---

class: center

The Indian Ocean Dipole is said to be ‘positive’ when the western pole is warmer than the eastern one, and ‘negative’ when it is cooler.The Indian Ocean Dipole and ENSO are not unrelated. So, positive IOD events are often associated with El Niño, and negative IOD events with La Niña. Therefore, when the IOD and ENSO happen at the same time, the Dipole is known to strengthen the impacts of the ENSO condition.

Many scientists like to describe the monsoon in terms of the movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, a region near the Equator where the trade winds of the northern and southern hemispheres come together.

During the monsoon season, this ITCZ is located over the Indian subcontinent. By September, as the temperature begins to go down, the ITCZ starts moving southwards of the Indian landmass, towards the equator, and further into the southern hemisphere.

# Geotail - P/G3

The geotail is a region in space that allows the best observations. The region exists as a result of the interactions between the Sun and Earth.

The Sun emits the solar wind, which is a continuous stream of charged particles. These particles are embedded in the extended magnetic field of the Sun. Since the Earth has a magnetic field, it obstructs the solar wind plasma. This interaction results in the formation of a magnetic envelope around Earth (see illustration). On the Earth side facing the Sun, the envelope is compressed into a region that is approximately three to four times the Earth radius. On the opposite side, the envelope is stretched into a long tail, which extends beyond the orbit of the Moon. It is this tail that is called the geotail.

Once every 29 days, the Moon traverses the geotail for about six days. When Chandrayaan-2, which is orbiting the Moon, crosses the geotail, its instruments can study the properties of the geotail

For the CLASS instrument seeking to detect element signatures, the lunar soil can be best observed when a solar flare provides a rich source of X-rays to illuminate the surface. Secondary X-ray emission resulting from this can be detected by CLASS to directly detect the presence of key elements like Na, Ca, Al, Si, Ti and Fe

# South Asia - the loser of trade war - G3

If there’s a loser, at least in terms of missed opportunities, it may be the countries of South Asia

Vietnam seems to be the consensus pick for winner of the US-China trade war, as Chinese and other manufacturers shift production to the cheaper Southeast Asian nation

African countries, too, are making manufacturing a top priority. Ethiopia alone has opened nearly a dozen industrial parks in recent years and set up a world-class government agency to attract foreign investment. The World Bank has lauded sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the highest number of reforms each year since 2012.

By contrast, in terms of foreign direct investment as a percentage of GDP, South Asia lags both the global average for least-developed countries and sub-Saharan Africa. While South Asia’s total GDP is more than 70% greater than Africa’s, the continent received three-and-a-half times the investment from China that South Asia received in 2012, the most recent year for which the United Nations has published bilateral FDI statistics. 

The fantasy, most common in India, that a country might somehow “leapfrog" from a rural, agriculture-heavy economy straight to a services-based economy is just that: a fantasy. South Asia can’t afford to lose this chance to grow its manufacturing sector.

---

class: center

Attracting manufacturing investments will require, first and foremost, that governments in the region acknowledge the competition is passing them by. India, for example, must abandon its overconfidence that investors will come simply for its large population

Secondly, South Asian countries need to undertake a concerted, whole-of-government push to boost investment levels. Specifically, they need to create the conditions manufacturers need to thrive, from steady power supplies to efficient port operations and customs clearance.

# Informal Summits -- G2/PSIR

Informal Summits act as supplementary exchanges to annual Summits and other formal exchanges such as the G20 Summit, EU-India Summit and the BRICS Summit among others, and allow for “direct, free and candid exchange of views” between countries, something that may not be possible to do through formal bilateral and multilateral meetings that are agenda driven, where specific issues are discussed, and outcomes are more concretely defined.

in November 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attended the ASEAN-India Informal Breakfast Summit in Singapore.

Since Informal Summits allow discussion on wide-ranging issues, they are not particularly purpose-specific, and are sometimes considered to play bigger roles in diplomatic dialogue than formal exchanges — the reason is that they tend to be more in-depth, and relatively flexible in intent and the scope of discussion.

China is not the only country with which India has had an Informal Summit. In May 2018, Modi met Russia’s President Vladimir Putin for their first Informal Summit in Russia’s Sochi to discuss international matters in a “broad and long-term perspective”.

# The Chinese Lead - G2/PSIR - Niranjan Rajadhyaksha

In economic terms, it’s around a dozen years ahead of us but the gap is much larger when social indicators are considered

The Chinese economy was 2.5 times the Indian economy at the turn of the century. It is now nearly five times larger.

Indian GDP in 2019 will be around $2.9 trillion. China crossed that mark in 2007. In other words, India is around a dozen years behind China in terms of economic size.

The average Chinese was twice as rich as the average Indian in the year 2000. She is now nearly five times richer.  The average income in India in 2019 will be an estimated $2,198. China was at this level in 2006. Once again, it is a gap of a dozen years.

What really distinguishes China from India is the ability of the former to grow rapidly on a sustained basis rather than in short bursts. For example, China doubled its per capital income from the $3,000 level in five short years. This is similar to the rate at which a country such as South Korea achieved in the 1980s.

Around a third of Indian children were stunted in 2014; China faced the problem with the same intensity way back in 1990. Less than a tenth of Chinese children below five years fall prey to stunting today.

In 2016, 81.4% of births in India were in proper medical centres. This has been an impressive improvement. However, China was at 94% as long back as 1990. Almost every birth in China today is overseen by a trained health worker.

In Indian cities, 72.01% of the population had access to at least basic sanitation services in 2017. Compare this with the 77.49% of Chinese city dwellers with access to sanitation in 2000, or the 90.79% today. It is much the same in the rural areas. 52.23% of Indian villagers had access to decent sanitation in 2017. China was at this level in 2005

China is around a dozen years ahead of India in purely economic terms but the gap is far larger when social indicators are considered. It is important to remember that China had crossed India’s current levels of social indicators when its per capita income was far lower than $3000.

A lot of the ongoing discussion about the gap between the two countries focuses on the former rather than the latter. However, they need to be considered together because of the interlinkages

India cannot provide a better quality of life to its citizens unless it maintains rapid economic growth on a sustained basis for at least the next two decades. And rapid economic growth will not be sustainable unless there are investments in human capital, especially if the demographic dividend is to be meaningful.

# Simplifying Labour Laws

India has 44 central, 387 state labour laws, 67 central and 1,333 state labour filings and 674 central and 26,484 labour compliances.

Multiplicity of laws, multiple enforcement authorities and multiple licenses, registrations and returns have created an environment which breeds non-compliance and lowers the guard on the very section we intend to protect and safeguard, pushing millions of citizens to informal employment.

What is needed is simplification, rationalization, digitisation of labour laws to make them comprehensive, effective, easy to comply. Subsuming our labour laws based on relevance into four labour codes is our first step in that direction. 

Upto 45% wage confiscation due to mandatory social security deductions has led to a large section of the workforce choosing to be informal. I have always believed that the only social security India can afford is more formal jobs, hence, this code is of particular interest to me.

# Why e-cig ban is a good move? - G2

Smoking-related diseases rank among the greatest public health problems of the last century. Smoking, it is feared, will kill around a sixth of the world’s population in the 21st century.

However, it is not enough to see smoking as just another bad habit. Commerce, social factors and the absence of state regulations play important roles in people getting hooked to tobacco.

However, there are positive signs. As per the second Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2016, India has seen the steepest decline in tobacco consumption (17 per cent) in any part of the world. 

nicotine is even more addictive than cocaine. Currently, there is no treatment for nicotine addiction. Moreover, nicotine even in its pure form is potentially carcinogenic. A dose of 30-50 mg of nicotine can kill an adult human.

“the use of e-cigarrettes should be regulated”. However, we feel its better to nip the problem in the bud. 

The editorial also talks of the rise in the share prices of ITC following the e-cigarette ban. This is inconsequential because cigarette use is declining steadily in India. Globally, the cigarette business is no more lucrative. And, in fact, e-cigarette seems to be the tobacco industry’s biggest hope.

---

class: center

Till date, there is no conclusive evidence that e- cigarettes prove beneficial in quitting cigarettes. On the contrary, it is known that among those who use e-cigarettes to stop smoking, 25 per cent use along it with cigarette and 75 per cent continue to use it even after quitting smoking.

Fears that the end users will not be conventional cigarette users but youngsters who are the prime targets of the e- cigarette industry are not unfounded.

We agree with the editorial that prohibition does not work. But that is true for cigarettes that have a huge consumer base. Since e-cigarettes have a small consumer base, a ban is likely to be effective. India does not manufacture e- cigarettes; so, the country will not suffer revenue losses.

The country is struggling to control multiple addictions — tobacco, pan masala, alcohol, cannabis — among the youth. The government’s decision to ban e-cigarettes is the way forward towards an addiction-free society.

# India and the Asian Market - G3

“If you want to be a successful global company, you cannot make the statement, ‘I am a successful global company’, unless you are a big deal in Asia."

Sadly, India continues to be among a handful of nations such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Uzbekistan that have historically had low integration with the rest of the region. 

Even the best Indian companies have made little effort to seriously explore Asian markets, especially China and Japan.

Nor has India’s most export-oriented industry—IT services—been able to crack the Asian puzzle.

This kind of concentration is fraught with risk. In the past, once-promising export sectors such as garments saw growth disappear once their primary markets, the US and Europe, imposed higher tariffs.

class: center

With decades of experience in global markets, back-end systems and processes configured to meet the most exacting standards, Indian IT companies need to be at the forefront of any concerted push into Asia, which, with Japan and China, is now home to the second and third-largest IT services markets in the world

Admittedly, access to both markets has been difficult, partly because of language and culture issues, but also because of significant non-tariff barriers.

China’s exports to India account for nearly 80% of the two-way trade between the countries, while in case of Japan, the figure is 60%, though that is partially offset by massive Japanese investment in India.


While Indian telecom firms seem keen to use the beleaguered Chinese company Huawei’s hardware, they have no access to China’s vast mobile telecom market, worth nearly $200 billion this year with some 1.5 billion subscribers.

# Green Wall along the Aravalli - G3

India is reportedly planning to undertake a vast reforestation exercise along the Aravalli hill range that stretches from the Ridge of Delhi to Banaskantha in Gujarat. 

What the government appears to have in mind is a “green wall of India", a 1,400km-long and 5km-wide green corridor all the way from Panipat in Haryana to Porbandar in Gujarat.

It would be modelled on the so-called Great Green Wall of Africa that was envisioned to run from Djibouti in the continent’s east to Senegal in its west.

This African green belt, proposed about a decade ago, was meant to act as a defensive flank against climate change, desertification and other forms of land degradation, but has fallen short of its targets for lack of coordination among the countries involved. In contrast, the Indian project is likely to face far fewer hurdles.

The geographical logic behind the proposal is clear. The Delhi metropolitan region’s expansion has resulted in widespread deforestation around the capital.

class: center

The Aravalli range, which separates western India’s Thar desert from the relatively green plains to its east, has lost so much green cover that it is losing its ability to act as a natural barrier against the heat and dust that blows in from the west. 

Without top-level intervention in favour of vegetation, environmentalists warn, the Thar desert’s expansion could even threaten the “granary of India"—the fertile belts of Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and the Malwa region.

# India and AI

Multiple calls taken by various governmental agencies have led to seemingly independent and often confusing strategies, resulting in conflict and a very real danger of ineffective execution.

Till date, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITy), the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), and the Niti Aayog have all released national strategy documents, each of them containing recommendations on governing structures, policy, as well as proposals on creation of new agencies. Surprisingly — and worryingly — there is no mention of how (and if) these structures will co-exist towards the goal of a unified AI strategy for the country.

Niti Aayog’s “National Strategy for AI” report allocates a budget of Rs 7,500 crore and recommends setting up Centers for Research Excellence (COREs) in conjunction with academic institutions. It also recommends setting up International Centers for Transformational AI (ICTAIs) in association with leading industry players

The DIPP is next, with a budget of Rs 1,200 crore towards setting up the National AI Mission (N-AIM). The N-AIM is supposed to be the nodal agency for all “AI related activities” in India which will also set up their own “centers of excellence” to promote interdisciplinary research, and assess the performance of various AI-based products in India.

---

class: center

The MEITy on the other hand plans to allocate a Rs 400-crore budget for new technology initiatives as part of the Digital India Programme, including working with the Digital India Corporation to set up yet another apex body for AI called the National Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).

Moreover, sector-specific AI applications, as diverse as facial recognition and crop classification, are being supervised by different state and central-level ministries with seemingly no consolidation around these national AI strategies. 

none of the recommendations highlighted earlier have yet been implemented in any useful form — this is in stark contrast to countries like Taiwan, which went from announcing a $36-million project to build a supercomputing platform to boost AI research

# PMC Bank crisis

Deepak Parekh, chairman of India’s largest mortgage lender HDFC, has slammed a system that regularly bails out companies and other large entities by loan write-offs and waivers, but is “brutally unfair" when it comes to protecting the common man’s savings.

PMC has admitted that it has exposure of ₹6,500 crore to realty firm Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL), an overwhelming 73% of its loan book of ₹8,880 crore. As it turns out, HDIL has allegedly diverted these funds, with PMC in no position to recover its loans

To save PMC from a bank run, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had to limit how much money depositors could withdraw.

As the regulator, RBI is expected to keep watch, but this offers no guarantee. A bank is a business at the end of the day. Money kept in one is subject to risks associated with any business.

By one proposal, depositors could be treated as financial creditors. This would make sense. And if a bankruptcy is to be resolved by offering them shares in lieu of their deposits, then they should accept it as the best they can get. It would be best, of course, if depositors keep track of the performance of their banks, just as investors do.

# Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure - G3

Envisaged as an international knowledge platform where countries can collaborate to make their existing and new infrastructure strong enough to withstand natural disasters, CDRI is the fruition of at least three years of discussions that India has had with more than 40 countries on this subject.

In simple terms, CDRI is an attempt to bring countries together to share and learn from the experiences of one another to protect their key infrastructure — highways, railways, power stations, communication lines, water channels, even housing — against disasters.

Future infrastructure needs to take into account the heightened risks arising out of the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and other adverse impacts of climate change.

Even existing infrastructure would need to be retrofitted to make them more resilient. Disaster-proofing a project would involve changes in design, and use of newer technologies. These involve additional costs which, however, are only a fraction of the losses that a disaster can bring.

Disaster preparedness and infrastructure creation are largely national endeavours. However, modern infrastructure is also a web of networked systems, not always confined to national boundaries. There are increasing numbers of trans-national and trans-continental highways and railways; transmission lines carry electricity across countries; assets on a river are shared. Damage to any one node can have cascading impacts on the entire network, resulting in loss of livelihoods and disruption in economic activity in places far away from the site of a disaster.

The CDRI secretariat too would be based in New Delhi

# Golden Triangle - G3

This broadly mountainous region covers north-eastern Myanmar, northern Thailand, northern Laos and the north-eastern corner of Vietnam.

This region is a major producer of Papaver somniferum, also known as opium poppy.

The morphine of the opium poppy is extracted from the latex. From this, heroin is produced, which enters the global market via southern China and Hong Kong.

According to a recent United Nations report, drug production has surged in the Golden Triangle. Many of the drug syndicates have switched to lab-produced crystal meth and other synthetic highs.

India has to keep a watchful eye.

# US - India (Ted Cruz) - PSIR/G2

India will risk losing intelligence from the U.S. if it allows Chinese telecom major Huawei to be part of its 5G infrastructure

On Kashmir -- the legal questions of how Kashmir is treated is for India to determine internally, and it is in the U.S.’s interests not to intrude on those questions. But at the same time, we hope not to see Kashmir produce a violent military conflict

On China -- China is the most significant geopolitical threat in this next century, for the U.S., India and the world. How we confront that growing Chinese threat is an enormous challenge and the most critical tool for confronting that threat is strong alliances with democracies throughout the region that have shared values, and a critical counterpoint to rising Chinese strength is a strong and rising India. That is in the U.S.’s interests and in India’s interests too.

India and the U.S. are friends and I believe we should be allies. [China’s] values are dramatically inconsistent with the values in the U.S. and India

On India-US trade deal -- We have seen India’s increased purchase of U.S. security and military systems, and also energy, which has an enormous upside. India has enormous needs for energy, which will continue to grow as its economy does and it is important for India to import from friends like the U.S. than from repressive dictatorships like Iran

# NJAC 2.0 -- G2

What was the proposed composition of the NJAC? The CJI was the chair, ex officio, and along with him were the next two senior judges. The Union Minister of Law and Justice was an ex officio member along with two eminent persons.

core functions are now being performed by a body minus the two eminent persons. So, the recommendation and appointment of judges has been taken over by a “new NJAC” and without any apparent protest

CJI had written to the law minister that 43 recommendations made by the collegium were pending with the government and the vacancies in the high courts were to the extent of about 37 per cent. Also, the collegium could not consider the appointment of 10 persons since some information was awaited from the government for varying periods. Who is calling the shots — the government?

It seems to me that the unconstitutional NJAC is rearing its head and is now Frankenstein’s monster. The advice of the two eminent persons postulated by the NJAC is no longer required. Actually, there is now no need to amend the Constitution to bring back the NJAC — it is already in existence with a vengeance.

# China-Nepal-India -- G2/PSIR

a crippling blockade of the Nepal border at Birgunj from the Indian side. China stepped in at the time to provide fuel and other essentials.

Modi’s three visits, and agreements for more infrastructure projects, including a rail line from Kathmandu to Raxaul at the border, have clearly not persuaded landlocked Nepal that the only friend it needs in the neighbourhood is India.

Xi’s generous assistance to Nepal of USD 495 million was of a piece with the style with which China makes friends with India’s neighbours. 

There is to be a feasibility study on a trans-Himalayan train link between the two countries, and a road link from Kathmandu to Kerung, on Nepal’s border with Tibet, as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. Both connections will increase Nepal’s access to the Chinese economy

To the extent that this pushes up the possibility of Chinese goods flooding India through Nepal, Delhi should be concerned.

But it must also come to terms with the reality that there can be no zero sum games in foreign policy. Viewing relations with neighbouring countries only through the prism of India’s security has its limits. As the region’s largest economy, India needs to find better ways to make friends with its neighbours, and retain these friendships.

# Institutional Research in India -- G2

Research in elite institutions must focus on the problems of their surrounding environment

The systematic study of such problems and their solutions will lead not only to better development outcomes, but also new science, enterprises and jobs.

The primary responsibility of solving them lies with our scientists and bureaucrats, not politicians. Unfortunately, this is not fully appreciated by our society or accepted by our elite institutions as their mandate.

The result is that our industry imports much of its sophisticated machinery. Our state agencies call on expensive international consultants even in traditional areas such as irrigation. International companies fill our pot-holes with cement, and foreign universities prepare our smart city plans and assess our drinking water systems.

Many of the development problems, for instance, water or public health, are on the State List. Most state departments do not make any provision for research in their budget simply because it may be too disruptive, or that they do not find viable partner institutions.

Thus, “why is my bus late” is as much a question for science to address as “why does a solar eclipse happen”. Only such an approach will enable us to fix our public transport, analyse the droughts of Marathwada or manage the sea of solid waste which drowns us all.

WF -- decentralisation of the agenda of science and democratisation of access to science and its methods

WF -- This will bring real science closer to schools and colleges and allow the community to participate in its own development

WF -- State Science and Technology Councils Programme (SSTCs)
