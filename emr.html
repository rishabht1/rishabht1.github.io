# Party System -- Suhas Palshikar

Four lessons about party politics and party building in Indian context

1 - Weakness in the way parties are organised -- Parties do talk about membership drives, but they often obfuscate intra-party democracy and intra-party competition. Tickets are bought, begged, stolen, but not distributed on any sound principles that would convince party workers to stay on with the party even when it denies them the ticket

2 - no mechanism to broker ambitions of party workers at any level of the party hierarchy -- Vulgar money, closeness to the leadership, recourse to community identity, and increasingly, show of muscle power, operate in situations of intra-party competition

3 - electoral victories for many candidates are so individualistic that they can easily override the party in their legislative performance and choices

4 - absence of ideology

# Cryptocurrency

the committee points out China as an example that has banned the use of cryptocurrencies. Recently, a Chinese court recognised cryptocurrency as digital property. While countries such as China have adopted harsher regulation in the past, their changing approach to cryptocurrencies cannot not be ignored

The committee proposes a new form of digital currency — the Digital Rupee — which will be the only digital currency permitted under Indian law

it is important to consider a reasonable policy that suitably balances technological innovation and protection of users and economic interests

# Metropolitan Planning

lack of urban planning in general and spatial planning (integrated land use and transport) in particular has left major scars on the city fabric with significant deterioration in the quality of public services and ease of living

The ad hoc extension of urban boundaries and regularisation of unauthorised colonies brings with them additional challenges for metropolitan governance and financing

Failure of MPCs

By default and not by design

the land use planner’s vision, the transport planner’s strategy and the urban economist’s perspective are not integrated

WF -- Decongesting growth centers, strengthening labour markets, building rural urban linkages

# Big data, big responsibility

NITI -- vision for making available anonymised data across sectors

ES -- “of the people, by the people, for the people” — making a bold call to harness data as a “public good” in the service of the people

As demonstrated by Cambridge Analytica and numerous other data breaches, poorly designed systems create risks for individuals, businesses and governments

recently, the Andhra Pradesh government websites publicly displayed the Aadhaar number of women, their reproductive history, whether they had an abortion and so on

Another website exposed the name and number of every person who purchased medicines from government-run stores, including those buying pills for erectile dysfunction

Consent -- ideal in theory, flawed in practice

---

Replace consent with rights

Designing -- databases should be designed in a manner that a department is not able to see the data that it does not need, irrespective of whether citizens give their consent or no

encryption not the silver bullet

WF -- decentralised storage of data, anonymisation at the source

# Institutional Independence

Not a binary

if the economy is in deep trouble, it is silly to think that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the finance ministry can act independently of each other -- same for Judiciary

The concept of independence has to be informed by the overall purpose for which an institution is created; in this case, delivering justice

The independence of institutions or individuals does not flow from the process used for appointments or the mechanisms used for coordination, but from an acute understanding of the larger interest such independence is supposed to serve

At times, institutions must share sovereignty for the public good; at other times, they must not be part of a general consensus when larger issues are at stake

# Data Localisation

polarising topic in India -- international companies v. voices calling data a sovereign asset

EU -- adequacy test -- GDPR

China -- certification

India's approach -- conventional

Where every other country has recognized data transfers as the norm, permitting the free flow of data across borders and only applying restrictions to either address inadequacies in the legal regime or in the privacy practices of the recipient, India has made localization the default, prohibiting the movement of data across national borders in all but a limited number of circumstances

Restrictions on cross-border data transfers over localisation
