# Tax Rules

Legal disputes ensue because tax laws are not drafted with clarity and are hence misused by tax officers

Such litigation adds to cases in the country’s already overburdened courts

New initiative -- Faceless Tax Scrutiny Assessment -- the assessing officer would not know the taxpayer’s identity and would use only the online filing, and technology platform, to scrutinise the details of the tax payer

There won’t be any personal interaction between the tax payer and the tax officer

Before resorting to faceless scrutiny, it would be desirable to make the current online assessment more taxpayer friendly

Fix accountability of tax officers and ensure that they pass assessment orders according to the tax statutes
