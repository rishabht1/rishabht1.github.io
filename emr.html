# Indian Dairy - G3

world’s largest milk producer -- per capita availability of 375 grams per day, three time more than what it was till the late 1970s

It is true that the European Union and the US convert their milk surpluses into mounds of powder and butter oil, creating distortions in global trade and artificially depressing prices. Also, huge quantities are dumped under the garb of humanitarian aid

In a scenario where global markets are manipulated and the countries responsible follow protectionist policies back home, a direct exposure of our farmers to international competition can be both risky and unfair

The sheer size of our domestic market — which will only increase with rising incomes and high elasticity of demand for milk and milk products — should ensure that we aren’t relegated to being a “price-taker”

WF - focus should shift from quantity to quality -- they do not meet the sanitary and phytosanitary standards required for exporting to developed markets

class: center

WF - Organised dairies have left the most profitable segment of indigenous milk sweets and preparations to the unorganised sector, which thrives on low capital base, generally disregards food standards and cares little for good manufacturing practices

WF - The fusion of technological processes and products, blending the best of ethnic and modern foods, and a cross-cultural approach to product development is the way forward

The possibilities for them are endless in the wake of expanding globalisation. Our dairies should view the world as their marketplace and turn to ethnic foods for even creating a new class of products with exotic appeal

# Zero Budget farming - unscientific - G3

country’s premier academy of agricultural scientists have come out against an “unproven technology” that, they say, brings no incremental gain to either farmers or consumers

The basic idea of “zero budget” itself rests on very shaky scientific foundations. Its propounder Subhash Palekar Palekar, for instance, claims that nitrogen, the most important nutrient for plant growth, is available “free” from the air

Yes, nitrogen makes up 78 per cent of the atmosphere, but being in a non-reactive diatomic (N2) state, it has to be first “fixed” into a plant-usable form — which is what ammonia or urea are

maintaining indigenous cows and collecting their dung and urine — the main ingredients in Palekar’s microbial, seed treatment and insect pest management solutions — entails labour cost.

Simply put, agriculture can never be zero budget. Also, crop yields cannot go up beyond a point with just cow dung that has only around 3 per cent nitrogen (as against 46 per cent in urea), 2 per cent phosphorous (46 per cent in di-ammonium phosphate) and 1 per cent potassium (60 per cent in muriate of potash).

class: center

WF - there is a strong case for promoting techniques such as conservation tillage, trash mulching, green manuring and vermi-composting, apart from reducing use of chemical fertilisers and insecticides through integrated nutrient and pest management

The time has also come for eliminating fertiliser subsidies to encourage their judicious use

The government should give farmers a fixed sum of money per acre, which they can use to buy chemical-based inputs or to engage the extra labour necessary for organic agricultural practices. 

Side - NPK - 421

if the PM wants to cut fertiliser consumption by half by 2022, why is the government investing in new urea plants of 1.27 million tonne, each under the public sector —at Gorakhpur in UP, Barauni in Bihar, Ramagundam in AP, Sindri in Jharkhand and Talcher in Odisha. The combined capacity of these plants is likely to be about 6.35 million tonne and the production cost more than $400 per tonne. One wonders whether there is any coordination between what the PM says and what his government is doing? It seems a typical case of left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing

fertiliser subsidy, which is budgeted at Rs 80,000 crore for 2019-20, be given directly to farmers on a per hectare basis and allow them to decide whether they want to do ZBNF or chemical-fertiliser based farming. The fertiliser prices will then be market determined, ensuring their efficient usage, stopping their diversion to non-agri-uses as well as to neighbouring countries.

# RCEP - against - G3

Wrong timing -- China would be looking to compensate for the export loss in the US turf, and RCEP provides the country a viable platform for this purpose

Even without an FTA with China, India’s trade deficit with the country has risen 13 times in the last decade. China, according to a NITI Aayog paper, accounts for around 50 per cent of India’s trade deficit. And the deficit is widening every year

The NITI Aayog paper also identified India’s major imports from and exports to China. The list reveals a disturbing trend. While China exports finished manufactured goods like electrical machinery, telecom equipment, audio and video recorders, organic chemicals and plastic articles, Indian top exports to China predominantly consist of raw materials like ores, copper, sulphur, salt, mineral fuels, oils and bituminous substances.

Reality of value chains -- Global or local, production value chains are not homogenous string of production process; they are value chains driven by very large multinational companies which produce the final finished goods and reap maximum benefit out of that chain.

The composition of Indo-Chinese trade indicates that Chinese companies are those engines of value chain. India languishes at the bottom end of that chain as a raw material supplier

India’s experience with FTAs has not been encouraging, except for the FTA with Sri Lanka. Trade gaps with ASEAN, South Korea and Japan have been increasing. The FTAs have resulted in the isolation of Indian companies, as Indian products on whom regular indirect taxes have been levied often face competition with goods imported from these FTA countries with lower or zero tariff rates

The country could, instead, do well to make realistic attempts to seize larger shares of smaller pies in regional trade cooperation — BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), for example.

# Demographic Dividend and School Education - G2

By next year, the average age of an Indian is expected to be 29 years, while it will be 37 in China and 48 in Japan

Additionally, around 12 million youth in India are now reaching the employable age each year

During the past 10 years, the Right to Education Act ensured a steady increase in school enrollment with more than 260 million children in the age group of six to 14 years enrolled in schools

However, this is only half the job done as just ensuring schooling does not result in learning. In India, according to ASER 2018, only a little over one-quarter of third grade students can read second grade text or subtract one two-digit number from another

The draft National Education Policy (NEP) identifies foundational literacy and numeracy — the ability to read, write and perform basic calculations — as prerequisites for all learning. The draft NEP states that attainment of foundational skills has to be given the highest priority, which, if not achieved, would render all other efforts irrelevant for a large section of population.

# Loan Waivers and impact on states - G3

Two approaches - 

either the concerned government’s fiscal deficit (or, in other words, total borrowing from the market) goes up or it has to cut down its expenditure.

A higher fiscal deficit, even if it is at the state level, implies that the amount of money available for lending to private businesses — both big and small — will be lower. It also means the cost at which this money would be lent (or the interest rate) would be higher. If fresh credit is costly, there will be fewer new companies, and less job creation.

More often than not, states choose to cut capital expenditure — that is the kind of expenditure which would have led to the creation of productive assets such as more roads, buildings, schools etc — instead of the revenue expenditure, which is in the form of committed expenditure such as staff salaries and pensions. But cutting capital expenditure also undermines the ability to produce and grow in the future.

# Myth of religious solidarity in IR - G2/PSIR

Reactions of several Muslim countries to India’s decision on Kashmir shows that political and economic interest bind nations — not ideologies.

Islamabad’s own willingness to put national interests above Islamic solidarity is seen in its response to Beijing’s ill-treatment of Uighur Muslims in China’s far Western province of Xinjiang. Pakistan’s prime minister Imran Khan who has been roaring like a lion on India’s oppression of Kashmir turns a mouse when he is asked about China’s repression of Muslims.

After Partition, Pakistan embarked on a massive campaign to promote Islamic solidarity with the Middle East. Bemused by Pakistan’s zeal for Islam, King Farouk of Egypt reportedly remarked in jest that he “did not know Islam was born on August 14, 1947”

Pakistan is not alone in viewing the Gulf through the Islamic prism. India did much the same. For far too long, Delhi had over-determined the Islamic factor in assessing the foreign policies of the UAE and Saudi Arabia and branded them as “pro-Pakistan”. No Indian Prime Minister visited Saudi Arabia between 1982 and 2010 and the UAE between 1981 and 2015. When India initiated interest-based engagement with these countries, there was a rapid improvement in bilateral relations.

# Reforming architecture of fiscal federalism - G2

1 - Only allow transfers through untied tax devolution and do away with CSS

Why imractical -- there may be externalities, effects that spillover beyond state boundaries, or issues of national importance such as food security, which cannot be left entirely to states

strong states may have the resources and capacity to design, finance and manage schemes on their own, but the weaker ones may not. Finally, given the long legacy of CSS, it is difficult to imagine that any central government would completely walk away from CSS, especially those that are popular and have considerable political mileage.

2 - make the FC a permanent body and expand its mandate to undertake the resource allocator role of the erstwhile Planning Commission

However, this option would not preserve the fiscal autonomy of states since the FC would decide what programs or projects should be allocated to which states.

3 - revive the Inter-States Council as an effective federal decision making body --  The Council should be supported by a secretariat of experts to design programmes and lay put the principles for their allocation among the states.

# RCEP - why sign? - G2

There is a tendency in Indian industry to seek protection, whenever any steps towards globalisation are taken. The “Bombay Club” long used for protectionism, protested when liberalisation was introduced and tried to prevent imports for as long as they could.

However, it is an acknowledged fact that globalisation did benefit the Indian economy, it brought in newer technology and made Indian industry far more competitive. RCEP does provide Indian industry a huge market to grow and expand, provided it transforms and the government frees it from bureaucratic controls that have been stifling growth.

Compare to liberalisation -- similar doubts

By entering RCEP, India may be able to get greater market access to even China as it is vulnerable due to its ongoing trade war with the US. More significantly, with China facing the demographic crunch, India could easily edge it out, if we go for economies of scale, made feasible by a large trading block like RCEP.

---

class: center

India’s presence in this trading block could lead to a large number of multinationals shifting their production facilities from China to India, as that would enable them to access Chinese markets, without being present there, to comply with US sanctions. This could also bring in huge investments from many companies in the West.

This is also one way of controlling China and keeping it in check. In a big grouping like this, China is unlikely to have its way, nor is it going to antagonise everyone. India’s absence from RCEP will virtually handover this significant grouping to China, which is certainly not in India’s interest

# Foreigners Tribunals - G2

The fate of close to two million people who have been excluded from the NRC rests with these one-man tribunals

The constitutionality of these quasi-judicial bodies — from the appointment of its members, arbitrary procedure for its functioning and the nature of its orders — have always been in question

The Supreme Court recently ruled that the order of the Foreigners Tribunals will prevail over the NRC order on citizenship and declined to create an appellate forum for appeal from the tribunals.

The members of the tribunal are selected by the Gauhati High Court, but the appointment is done through the home and political department of the Assam government.

The minutes of the monitoring committee of the HC reveal that the government is also asked to send its appraisal of tribunal members to the court. The performance report of the government has a special column — “percentage of foreigners declared”. Extension is often given to those who have declared the maximum number of persons as foreigners — the low scorers are “terminated”.

# Moon Landing - G3

Even China’s Chang’e 4, which became the first spacecraft to land on the far side of the moon (the side that does not face the earth), landed near the 45 degree latitude.

It is easier and safer to land near the equator. The terrain and temperature are more hospitable, and conducive for longer and sustained operation of instruments. The surface here is even and smooth, very steep slopes are almost absent, and there are fewer hills or craters. Sunlight is present in abundance, at least on the side facing the earth, thus offering regular supply of energy to solar-powered instruments.

The polar regions of the moon, however, are a very different, and difficult, terrain. Many parts lie in a completely dark region where sunlight never reaches, and temperatures can go below 230 degree Celsius. Lack of sunlight and extreme low temperatures create difficulty in operation of instruments. In addition, there are large craters all over the place, ranging from a few cm in size to those extending to several thousands of kilometres.

---

class: center

Why India planned to go polar? -- There are indications of presence of ice molecules in substantial amounts in the deep craters in this region. In addition, the extremely cold temperatures here mean that anything trapped here would remain frozen in time, without undergoing much change. The rocks and soil in this region could therefore provide clues to early solar system.

# US China Trade War and India - G2

these disruptions open up an opportunity for India to expand trade with the US and China—by filling in supply gaps. 

one might be pessimistic about the possibility of India stepping in to close the supply gaps created by the US-China trade war. India’s top global exports are precious stones and jewellery, pharmaceuticals, metals, minerals, refined petroleum and textiles—product categories that account for roughly half of India’s exports and bear little resemblance to China’s export basket—which is dominated by machinery and office equipment and miscellaneous light manufactures.

However, the scale of Chinese exports (roughly ten times India’s exports) implies that even small changes to some of China’s less significant exports may create opportunities of significant scale for countries such as India. For instance, Chinese textiles account for nearly 20% of US textile imports while Indian exports account for only a little over 5%

Indian machinery exports would increase by over 40%, were India to take over a mere 1% of Chinese machinery exports.

---

class: center

It is no surprise, then, that other countries, with more agile policy responses and more business friendly environments, such as Vietnam, have been far more successful than India in attracting firms exiting China. Indeed, Vietnam’s exports to the US last year have risen by more than 40%— a truly remarkable increase—driven largely by firms that have relocated from China.

The danger with footloose capital, somewhat akin to highly footloose portfolio investment, is that it may leave just as easily as it had arrived with even a small change in incentives either in India or abroad. Thus, should circumstances change, between the US and China or in other potential host countries, such as Vietnam and Thailand, these investments may exit India as rapidly as they had entered.

PGS is a process of certifying organic products, which ensures that their production takes place in accordance with laid-down quality standards. The certification is in the form of a documented logo or a statement.

PGS, according to this definition, is “a process in which people in similar situations (in this case small holder producers) assess, inspect and verify the production practices of each other and take decisions on organic certification”.

4 pillars -- participation, shared vision, transparency, trust

Advantages -- 
* Procedures are simple, documents are basic, and farmers understand the local language used.
* All members live close to each other and are known to each other. As practising organic farmers themselves, they understand the processes well.
* Because peer appraisers live in the same village, they have better access to surveillance; peer appraisal instead of third-party inspections also reduces costs
* Mutual recognition and support between regional PGS groups ensures better networking for processing and marketing.
* Unlike the grower group certification system, PGS offers every farmer individual certificates, and the farmer is free to market his own produce independent of the group.

---

Limitations - 
* PGS certification is only for farmers or communities that can organise and perform as a group within a village or a cluster of continguous villages, and is applicable only to farm activities such as crop production, processing, and livestock rearing, and off-farm processing “by PGS farmers of their direct products”.
* Individual farmers or group of farmers smaller than five members are not covered under PGS. They either have to opt for third party certification or join the existing PGS local group.
* PGS ensures traceability until the product is in the custody of the PGS group, which makes PGS ideal for local direct sales and direct trade between producers and consumers.

# Trade and Diplomacy - G2/PSIR

Trade and diplomatic initiatives need to complement each other for a country to leverage the potential of its economy

India’s external affairs minister S. Jaishankar recently said that trade interests, and not diplomacy, will decide India’s participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement

While it is obvious that any trade agreement must be decided on its merits, smart diplomacy can aid in advancing our overall trade and strategic interests.

Trade benefits may emanate not only from the deal being negotiated, but also from strengthening existing trade relations, the opening of new trade avenues, and the fostering of competitiveness among domestic producers.

The RCEP holds enormous potential to facilitate economic growth and stability in the region, and to help make it free, open and inclusive.

It could also be used as a key instrument to balance Asia-Pacific and Indo-Pacific constructs for shared prosperity with security. We can also use it as an anchor to launch several mini-lateral initiatives in the region, with countries like Australia, Indonesia and Japan, to strengthen our maritime connectivity and allow for the emergence of alternative power centres.

Responsibility of Center -- The constitutional assignments between the central and subnational governments in federations are done broadly on the basis of their respective comparative advantage.

The amendment to the terms of reference (TOR) issued to the Fifteenth Finance Commission asking it to examine “..a separate mechanism for funding of defence and internal security ought to be set up and if so, how such a mechanism could be operationalised,” has triggered some suggestions on the need to have a relook at the assignment system and redesign of centrally sponsored schemes (CSS)

# India-US trade (Economic angle) - G2/PSIR

C Raja Mohan

In diplomacy, personal rapport and trust between the leaders is quite valuable. Although the leaders themselves might not negotiate the details of agreements, they need to communicate their respective interests to each other and signal the political will to overcome domestic obstacles.

Even more important is the recognition of your interlocutor’s priorities. When you address the other leader’s most important concern and give him or her room to claim victory, you will get a lot more in return. In the last two decades, the success of India’s engagement with the US has been rooted in Delhi’s sensible judgement about the immediate focus of the other leader.

Modi saw that addressing climate change was President Barack Obama’s highest priority. Modi, who had sensible climate convictions of his own, quickly reoriented India’s policy to make Delhi part of the solution in the stalled international negotiations on mitigating global warming. When he was a senator, Obama had expressed serious reservations about the nuclear deal. Once he saw Modi as a partner, Obama helped finalise the nuclear agreement and integrate India into the global nonproliferation regimes.

# NPAs and electoral corruption - G3

But why do governments in India insist that loans be given to industrialists, even when their projects are not good enough to generate the money needed to repay the bank?

This question has much to do with the curse of crony capitalism -- the nexus between businessmen and politicians is based on a classic exchange of favours: The former help the latter to get access to credit in return for funds for election campaigns.

Politics has become a very costly activity in India. According to several estimates — including those by the Centre for Media Studies and the Association for Democratic Reforms — India’s 17th general elections were the costliest ever in the history of democracies, with the parties spending $7.2 billion (more than double what was spent 10 years ago).

# Waste Management - G3

The first rule of waste management all over the world is that households must keep their wastes separate before it is collected from the doorstep. The Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 in our country prescribe the same. 

First, the good news. Tamil Nadu has achieved 100 per cent segregation in 20 of its 50 smaller municipalities, and 80 to 90 per cent in the rest.

The wet waste can be composted locally; the dry recyclable waste can go for recycling and what remains can be safely disposed. 

Pushbacks - 

first, from seemingly superior technology, which is actually retrograde. Earlier in these columns, we talked of the perils of waste-to-energy plants which rely on the incineration of mixed waste. Such plants in India have been either non-starters or highly polluting failures. Even so, several cities are promoting incineration of mixed waste.

The practice of entering into waste transport contracts with private parties in which payment for waste transportation is made on a tonnage basis provides an incentive to maximise the weight of waste any which way.

---

class: center

3 - use of compactors -- Compactors are the antithesis of segregation. The compacted waste is unfit for any resource recovery or safe disposal. Use of compactors on mixed waste makes it almost impossible to extract the recyclable dry waste such as plastics, metal, paper and cardboard from the mixture.

The compression of wet waste in the mixture releases leachate (a black foul-smelling liquid) that is difficult to dispose. Leachate percolates into the soil and contaminates groundwater. When it drains off into the sewer system, it overloads the sewage treatment plants.

WF -- A much smarter alternative for municipalities under the Smart Cities Mission would be to promote decentralised composting of wet waste, tie-up with local “kabadiwalas” or NGOs for recyclable dry waste, and work on safe disposal of the rest

WF -- The savings from eliminating costly secondary transport can easily fund the construction and operation of decentralised centres for the processing of wet and dry waste. 

Today, New York plans near-zero waste to landfill by 2030, which is in line with our Rules 2000. The difference is that they are working towards it, while we are far from enforcing the Rules.

# Paika Rebellion 1817 - G1

Paikas had been recruited since the 16th century by kings in Odisha from a variety of social groups to render martial services in return for rent-free land (nish-kar jagirs) and titles.

After entering Odisha in 1803, the British introduced new revenue settlements, due to which many Odia proprietors ended up losing their lands to absentee Bengali landlords.

Changes in the currency and revenue systems meant the Odias had to pay taxes in silver, which was more expensive for them, and resulted in their further marginalisation and oppression.

During the course of the rebellion, government buildings in Banapur were set on fire, policemen and British officials were killed, and the treasury was looted. The uprising lasted for a few months but was eventually crushed by the better-equipped and trained forces of the East India Company.

Known in Spanish as the ‘Guerra Civil’, the conflict pitted Spain’s democratically elected Republican government against forces led by General Francisco Franco, who seized power in 1939 after three years of brutal warfare that left over 5 lakh dead.

Franco was supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, as well as by conservative elements within Spain. The Republican government was helped by the Soviet Union and by volunteer forces from democratic countries in Europe and the US.

The major European democracies of the time, Britain and France, shied from helping Spain’s Republican government officially, despite Germany and Italy’s backing of Franco on a massive scale. The Civil War is thus regarded by many as one of the key harbingers of World War II.

# Coal gasification - G1

Coal gasification is the process of converting coal into synthesis gas (also called syngas), which is a mixture of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2)

The syngas can be used in a variety of applications such as in the production of electricity and making chemical products, such as fertilisers.

According to the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers, urea is currently produced using pooled natural gas, which comprises of both domestic natural gas and imported LNG. The usage of locally available coal for making fertilisers would help reduce the import of LNG, the Ministry said.

# PDS reforms - G3

One nation, one ration -- we must approach this bold vision with utmost caution because PDS is a crucial lifeline for many of the 800 million Indians it reaches -- Even well-intentioned changes that shock the system can therefore have potentially catastrophic outcomes for some

In 2017, it was reported that a 11-year old Dalit girl named Santoshi Kumari from Jharkhand died when her family was unable to access rations in the aftermath of large-scale revisions in the beneficiary list

Over 18 starvation deaths have been reported in the state since September 2017. Such tragedies must be prevented at all costs and we should therefore be cautious while restructuring the program.

fundamental processes related to the PDS need to be redesigned to empower every individual. The State of Aadhaar Survey 2017-18 found that nearly 6.5 per cent of PDS beneficiaries in Rajasthan were denied ration because the shopowner claimed to be out of food grain. This translates to over 3.5 million people in Rajasthan alone. A beneficiary has no mechanism to question whether the shop owner is telling the truth or diverting rations. Portability and biometrics will not solve this problem completely.

Andhra --  state government collects feedback in real time through a mobile-based system. The central government should use this opportunity to make PDS more user-centric. It should track denial of service on a real-time basis through mobile-based surveys. It should commission research on the experiences of particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, migrants, disabled and tribals to modify the process where needed

The system should enable real time tracking of inventories and rapid response to low stock situations.

The government should also acknowledge that authentication failures will happen in any biometric system. Studies by ISB in multiple states point to a 1-3 per cent failure rate, potentially affecting 8-24 million people at a national scale. To prevent denial of service, the government should ensure availability of non-biometric means of authentication (such as OTP or PIN), as well as manual overrides.

Start small -- intra-state portability --  increase their operational and technical capacity.

Such a gradual rollout will prevent transition glitches that show up as harmless statistics in reports, but are a matter of life and death for millions in our country

# Quantum Supremacy - P

Quantum supremacy refers to a quantum computer solving a problem that cannot be expected of a classical computer in a normal lifetime. This relates to the speed at which a quantum computer performs.

The phrase “quantum supremacy” was coined in 2011 by John Preskill, Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology in a talk he delivered on the benefits of using quantum hardware over traditional computers.
