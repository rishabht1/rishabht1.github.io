# Sovereign Bonds -- Criticism

could prove addictive

Indiaâ€™s sovereign external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is among the lowest globally at less than 5%

consequences could be disastrous in the long run

almost all macroeconomic crises in emerging economies emanated from issues relating to foreign exchange

the Asian crisis of the late 1990s originated with unsustainable foreign currency debts, as have most macroeconomic crises in Latin America and Africa

Apart from 1991, which was a singular episode, triggered by the spike in oil prices and the collapse of remittances from workers abroad following the first Gulf War, India has been largely immune from major macroeconomic disturbances emanating from overseas.

Honey traps by Wall Street investment bankers -- offer the world, filled with risks

Not a protectionist argmument -- difference between free flow of goods and free flow of capital

# Democratic Education

our votes might be effective in throwing out the governments we dislike but are ineffective in giving us efficient and good governments

literacy and education by themselves do not create good citizens or mature democracies --> on qualifications for candidature

ability to imagine and achieve minimally common good --> conversations through debate, dialogue and deliberations

common and reciprocal sense of justice

good liberal arts education
