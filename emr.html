# Polygraph and Narcoanalysis

Polygraph -  based on the assumption that physiological responses that are triggered when a person is lying are different from what they would be otherwise

Instruments like cardio-cuffs or sensitive electrodes are attached to the person, and variables such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, change in sweat gland activity, blood flow, etc., are measured as questions are put to them. 

Narcoanalysis - involves the injection of a drug, sodium pentothal, which induces a hypnotic or sedated state in which the subject’s imagination is neutralised, and they are expected to divulge true information -- “truth serum”

India -- no lie detector tests should be administered “except on the basis of consent of the accused”

Those who volunteer must have access to a lawyer, and have the physical, emotional, and legal implications of the test explained to them by police and the lawyer,

The results of the tests cannot be considered to be “confessions”, because those in a drugged-induced state cannot exercise a choice in answering questions that are put to them.

However, any information or material subsequently discovered with the help of such a voluntarily-taken test can be admitted as evidence

# TRAFFIC on Tigers

TRAFFIC -- WWF and IUCN

A new report has quantified the illegal global trade in tigers and tiger parts over a 19-year period between 2000 and 2018

India is the country with the highest number of seizure incidents (463, or 40% of all seizures) as well as tigers seized (625). In terms of various body parts seized, India had the highest share among countries for tiger skins (38%), bones (28%) and claws and teeth (42%)

# Governement Bailouts

K Subramanian, CEA -- bailouts amounts to socializing losses, and privatizing profits

The US government in 2009-09 had then unveiled a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to fund with taxpayer money the rescue of large financial services companies, some of them deemed “too big to fail"

bailouts go against the principles of free-market competition. They perversely reward poor business risk management at the cost of taxpayers, thus setting up a moral hazard—since businesses would be less likely to fear and mitigate their risks if they expect to be bailed out.

Are Indian private companies also getting overly dependent on public support? This is not clear, since many of them are merely asking the government to eliminate obstacles, rather than render financial help. 

So long as they seek reforms that allow market forces to operate freely, they should not be faulted

# Beijing and Kashmir

Despite the isolation of China at the UNSC, the message to India was clear: Beijing would join forces with Pakistan to hurt Indian interests at every possible forum

There were many in India who, rather unreasonably, expected China to moderate its behaviour vis-à-vis India in light of the so-called “Wuhan spirit".

By backing Pakistan’s request for the UNSC to discuss India’s latest move, China has signalled its priorities and made any normalization of ties almost impossible.

China’s response is also driven by its wider interests as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has pushed China to be even more aggressive on Kashmir

With China reportedly planning to set up a permanent military base in Pakistan for CPEC, India should be prepared for greater Chinese meddling on this matter

class: center

India’s deft diplomatic handling of the situation has ensured that China stands isolated at the UN. This has been happening repeatedly now. Earlier this year, China was isolated while trying to protect Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist, but had to later backtrack in the face of global opinion

as India becomes a more proactive player in the international order and China’s troubles with the rest of the world continue to grow, Beijing will target New Delhi even more pointedly

China can’t expect that its priorities on trade and 5G would be considered favourably by India if it continues to challenge the fundamentals of good neighbourly ties

If China is so aggressive on Kashmir, then nothing stops India from raking up issues like Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Tibet and Taiwan remain Chinese vulnerabilities

It should realize that there is no major constituency left in India today that has a favourable view of China

If China has a long-term strategy of containing India within South Asia, then India can just as easily adopt a strategy of challenging China’s core interests

# India - France

enhancing bilateral cooperation in strategic sectors. France has always been an important partner in the development of advanced technologies. This is set to advance further with the consolidation of civil nuclear cooperation and enhancing space cooperation

the new commitment to go beyond the buyer-seller relationship in the field of weapons procurement. When India comes up with clear policies for making arms in India, the synergies between India’s large defence market and the French strengths in armament production would come into full play

political cooperation between India and France is relatively new; it began with French support for India in limiting international sanctions on Delhi after its 1998 nuclear tests. Today, France has emerged as India’s most reliable partner on issues relating to terrorism and Kashmir.

the relationship between India and France has gone beyond the bilateral to focus on the regional. Modi and Macron this week have agreed to intensify maritime and naval cooperation in the Indian Ocean and more broadly the Indo-Pacific

it is the prospect of global agenda-setting that is beginning to make the India-France strategic partnership very exciting. After their joint efforts to limit climate change and develop the Solar Alliance, India and France have turned to more ambitious ideas

# Democratic Values

Democracy is not just a set of institutions but also a set of values

Democratic values include the ability to accommodate a diverse range of viewpoints that requires civility of conduct, a commitment to egalitarian ideals, the idea of universal citizenship — encompassing rights but also duties, allowing all sections of the populace to be heard despite the louder voice of the majority, and, a general commitment to the common good over individual desires. 

The relationship between democratic institutions and democratic values is symbiotic: The former are there to safeguard the latter and to exemplify them in their own conduct.

In turn, the foremost democratic value is respect for institutions

# Indentured Labourers

The migration of indentured labour—bonded labour—is a lesser known part of the history of slavery and that of Indian migration

International Day for Remembrance of the Slave Trade and Abolition -- UNESCO -- 1998

Indentured servitude from India started in 1834 and lasted up till 1922, despite having been officially banned in 1917 by British India’s Imperial Legislative Council after pressure from freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi

In Europe in the 1820s, there was a new kind of liberal humanism where slavery was considered inhuman -- It was following this ideology that the colonisers stopped slavery in India, only to replace it with another form of bonded servitude and euphemistically term it ‘indentured labour’

This practice of indentured labour resulted in the growth of a large diaspora with Indo-Carribean, Indo-African and Indo-Malaysian heritage that continue to live in the Carribean, Fiji, Réunion, Natal, Mauritius, Malaysia, Sri Lanka etc.

indentured migration started post the abolition of slavery to run sugar and rubber plantations that the British had set up in the West Indies

class: center

The British Empire was expanding to South America, Africa and Asia and they needed new labour, but slavery was considered inhuman. So they developed the concept of contract labour,

The British turned to India and China that had a large population and found the surplus labour they needed to run these plantations in the new colonies

After ruining the agriculture business in India, they exploited the mass unemployment that had hit small farmers the hardest

They were poor farmers and the indenture lasted for 10 years. They were paid monthly wages and were living on the plantations in these colonies

Initially, single men were selected for indenture but the British Parliament decided to encourage family migration to provide “stability”

The British attempted to disassociate indentured labour from slavery by calling it an “agreement” when recruiting Indians who would be willing to migrate, to try and hide the true nature of the practice

Why Slavery?

Most aspiring migrants were misled about the work they would have to engage in, the wages they would receive, the living conditions and the places they were travelling to

The system subjected poor, vulnerable Indians to long-term abuse and exploitation and the pain of these indentured migrants has been recorded through music, books, photographs and other forms of literature

The journey by sea was long and traumatic, with travel taking approximately 160 days to reach the Caribbean colonies. The comfort of the migrants was not even a consideration for the British and the travellers were loaded onto cargo cargo ships that were not meant to carry passengers

Many migrants were forced to sit on open decks that left them vulnerable to direct, harsh weather at sea. Sanitation was poor and there was little access to food and medication. These conditions were particularly difficult for small children and there was high mortality. Those who died on board were simply thrown off the ships into the sea

The migrants also faced physical and sexual abuse at the hands of the European ship captains and there was no means of escape except jumping off the ship into the water

---

class: center

The migrants took their culture with them through their language, food and music and the meagre belongings that they were permitted to carry. Once they reached these colonies, they created their unique socio-cultural ecosystems while they were limited to living in the confines of these large plantations

500,000 people migrated to Malaysia to work on plantations where many died of snake bites, hunger, diarrhea but no authorities paid attention to the difficulties that migrants faced in these colonies

Some migrants came back from colonies in East Africa but were not welcome. Their families had forgotten them and there was a cultural gap that had resulted due to the years the migrants had spent overseas

For some others, however, the cultural stigma of having a significant amount of time overseas and untouchability associated with the journey, resulted in a denial of acceptance once they returned to India
