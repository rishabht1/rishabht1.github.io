# Sovereign Bonds -- Criticism

could prove addictive

India’s sovereign external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is among the lowest globally at less than 5%

consequences could be disastrous in the long run

almost all macroeconomic crises in emerging economies emanated from issues relating to foreign exchange

the Asian crisis of the late 1990s originated with unsustainable foreign currency debts, as have most macroeconomic crises in Latin America and Africa

Apart from 1991, which was a singular episode, triggered by the spike in oil prices and the collapse of remittances from workers abroad following the first Gulf War, India has been largely immune from major macroeconomic disturbances emanating from overseas.

Invoice matching is still not operational

ITC means deducting the tax paid on inputs from the tax payable on the final output

# Corporate Social Responsibility

companies have a social responsibility, but it is not to engage in philanthropy

their fundamental social responsibility is to generate wealth for their shareholders in a law-abiding, ethical and sustainable way. When they do that, they generate surpluses for society, provide consumers with goods and services that they need, create employment, purpose and dignity among workers, and strengthen the nation

The government can encourage this—through tax deductions, public acclamation and moral suasion—but has no business intervening in those decisions

# Triple Talaq

473 cases in last 2 years -- after the SC judgement

the incidence of triple divorce is negligible and the issue was blown out of proportion for political reasons

the penal provision in the ordinance had no deterrent effect

there is a distinction between an act being declared “invalid” and being made an “offence”. The Supreme Court declared triple divorce as invalid and did not ask the government to make it a penal offence

Every punishment which does not arise from absolute necessity, according to Montesquieu, is tyrannical. In fact, criminal law should be used only as a “last resort” (ultima ratio) and only for the “most reprehensible wrongs”

Argument -- TT is a 'sin' under Islamic law -- hence it can be penalised -- Are we going in the direction of religious theocracy?

criminal law reflects the idea of “power” rather than “justice”

---

Claim -- it is a bailable offence. Reality -- judge's discretion

Bound to fail in oral divorces -- when no one other than the couple is present -- burden of proof

We are doing a huge disservice to Muslim women as no husband on his return from jail is likely to retain the wife on whose complaint he had gone to prison -- The Bill will lead to more divorces and abandonment

remedy to tackle triple divorce is thus worse than the disease

Three years’ imprisonment in the new Bill is excessive and is disproportionate. The Indian Penal Code provides far lesser sentences for graver crimes. The TTB obliterates the distinction between “minor” and “major” crimes

# Farming and Solar Evergy

why the annadata (farmer) cannot become the urjadata (producer of solar power)

doubling farmer's income + target of 100GW solar power by 2022

farmers occupy the largest chunks of land in this country. This model will be much more inclusive and can help augment their incomes significantly

Two variants --

Replace all pumpsets with solar pumps -- excess power could be brought by the state govts

encourage farmers to grow “solar trees” on their lands at a height of about 10-12 feet in a manner that enough sunlight keeps coming to plants below

Power generated in the second type is multiple times more than the previous one

Until now, the Taliban has insisted that the US must withdraw all its forces from Afghanistan. The US, on the other hand, wants to leave a small force to execute counter-terror missions. Pakistan is expected to nudge the Taliban into accepting a phased withdrawal of American troops

Delhi has also got better at navigating the triangular dynamic with Pakistan and the United States

Delhi has also become adept at turning the crises with Pakistan to focus less on Kashmir and more on the sources of terrorism originating from Pakistani soil

The biggest change, however, is the decision in Delhi to stop being defensive on Pakistan and Kashmir. We have seen so in the response of the Modi government to the terror attacks at Uri in 2016 and Pulwama in 2019

#Competittion Policy and Changing Business Environment

Competition Act of 2002 -- establishes the Competition Commission as the arbiter of any activities that may have an “adverse effect on competition in India"

The Act is now inadequate to deal with the changing business environment in telecommunications, technology and e-commerce, and the government’s own role in distorting competition

consumer data and behaviour is the “asset" around which a monopoly or an oligopoly can exist

Private corporations or the government can abuse this asset by monopolizing it to deliver a range of goods and services

A government may abuse its power to regulate by preferring large domestic corporations over foreign ones, or by interfering in pricing

In India, you are beginning to see emerging corporate concentrations in consumer industries related to data and e-commerce and payments

on one hand, creating the only truly interoperable backbone in the world for payments (the Unified Payments Interface)

on the other interfering directly in the payments industry by abolishing the merchant discount rate, and promoting a government-created consumer app called Bhim

The long-standing Indian interference tradition has led to landmark interventions that include the nationalization of banks (1969), abolishment of front-end loads for mutual fund sales (2009) and the wide-spread subsidy for LPG sales

WF - 

updated competition policy in India must simultaneously focus on the objectives of free and fair competition, consumer welfare and the abuse of monopoly power wielded by government and companies

The Competition Commission must have the authority (and the will) to investigate and charge the government with “distortion of competition" if it interferes micro-economically with pricing or arbitrarily favours private companies with regulation

# Difficult to enforce legislations

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, Code on Wages, Companies (Amendment) Bill (CSR)

should Parliament pass laws that the government cannot enforce?

Y - better to have these strong laws on the books, as the prospect of severe punishment can be used to deter individuals from breaking rules

Y - As India develops more state capacity in the future, these laws will be primed for better enforcement

Y? - this view does not take into account the kind of incentives created by under-enforcement and its unintended consequences

N - low capacity to enforce leads to arbitrary enforcement. So, some individuals will get away while others will be punished. This tends not to be random. Typically, rich and politically well-connected individuals get away. Opposition is targeted for selective enforcement.

---

class: center

N - a rule violator weighs the expected costs and benefits of breaking a rule

N - One simple way by which more crime occurs in society is criminalizing more activities. To deter certain actions by criminalizing them increases the amount of crime in society and reduces the probability of being punished -- enforcement resources are constrained

N - even sensibly crafted pre-existing laws that were enforced to some degree will now be enforced to a less degree because of overloading of the enforcement infrastructure

WF - stop passing laws that simply overload the system and cannot be enforced

WF - focus on infrastructure and capacity building

WF - third step is to free up existing state capacity by reducing or repealing onerous regulations in almost every area of social and economic conduct -- streamlining and simplification

# Currency Manipulation

Exchange Rate determination -- ideally, determined by the interplay of its demand and supply. If more Indians want to buy US goods, there would be a higher demand for the dollar relative to the rupee

Most governments and central banks are bothered about generating more growth and employment at home. A weaker domestic currency comes in very handy when governments are trying to attract foreign demand and boost exports.

China’s economic growth has been essentially fuelled by exporting to the world

if China’s central bank buys dollars in the forex market, it can artificially weaken the yuan — and Chinese goods will then become more affordable (and competitive) in the international market

what makes the Chinese phone cheaper? If it is the case that China is more efficient at making the phone, then nobody can complain. But if China is artificially reducing the “price” of its currency — by devaluing the yuan relative to the dollar or the rupee — it will be accused of manipulating its currency

# Economic v Political integration

Europe -- EU

Historically, Most of the large business groups in Inida had only a regional presence

The manifold failures of the Indian public sector are common knowledge. But it also created the managers, scientists, technicians, administrators and bankers who once formed the backbone of the Indian middle class. The public sector was thus an important driver of economic integration

The end of the special status for Kashmir is part of a political project—and will largely be seen through that prism. However, the political project will flounder unless it brings economic opportunity in its wake

# Central Bank Independence - R. Rajan

In theory, central bank independence means that monetary policymakers have the freedom to make unpopular but necessary decisions, particularly when it comes to combating inflation and financial excesses, because they do not have to stand for election

This arrangement gives investors more confidence in a country’s monetary and financial stability

Made scapegoats -- 2008 crisis

A central bank’s mandate requires it to ease monetary policy when growth is flagging, even when the government’s own policies are the problem

populist leaders may mistakenly believe the central bank can do more to rescue the economy from their policy mistakes than it actually can deliver

# New Report by IPCC

presents the most recent evidence on how the different uses of land — forests, agriculture, urbanisation — are affecting and getting affected by climate change

__Land-Climate__ -- 

land acts as both the source as well as a sink of carbon

Activities like agriculture and cattle rearing, for example, are a major source of methane and nitrous oxide, both of which are hundreds of times more dangerous than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas

largescale land use changes, like deforestation or urbanisation, or even a change in cropping pattern, have a direct impact on the overall emissions of greenhouse gases

The report says that if pre-production activities like cattle rearing and post-production activities like transport, energy and food processing, is taken into account, then food production could contribute as much as 37 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions every year.

---

class: center

It points out that nearly 25 per cent of all food produced is either lost or wasted. And even the decomposition of the waste releases emissions.

afforestation, and reduction in deforestation, are vital approaches in a global strategy to combat climate change

India’s action plan on climate change too, has a very important component on forests. India has promised that it would create an additional carbon sink of about 2.5 billion to 3 billion tonnes by the year 2032 by increasing its forest cover, and planting more trees

The Indian diplomatic objective is to get the rest of the world to live with the new reality in Kashmir, if not accept it

A similar case to Pokharan 1998 -- took India 10 years

The real test for Indian diplomacy, including with the US, comes when Delhi lifts the massive security blanket over Kashmir and Pakistan unleashes its terror proxies. That in turn sets the stage for a muscular Indian response, an inevitable escalation of the conflict with Pakistan and the intensification of great power interest in Kashmir. That is when India’s strategies for internal security, territorial defence and diplomacy will have to act in unison

# Economic inequality and mobility

There has been a phenomenal rise in economic inequality in India, especially in the post-1991 liberalization period

According to the Global Wealth Report (GWR) 2017, put out by the Credit Suisse Research Institute, between 2002 and 2012, the share of the bottom 50% of the population in total wealth declined from 8.1% to only 4.2%

it is imperative to accurately measure the extent of economic mobility in India, which reflects the number of people moving up and down the economic ladder over time

Economic mobility (or a lack thereof) can attenuate (or accentuate) the adverse effects of inequality

Holding other factors fixed, an economy with much economic mobility—one in which households move more freely throughout the income/consumption distribution—will result in a more equal distribution of lifetime incomes and consumption than an economy with low mobility

Muslims are more vulnerable to falling below the poverty line over the seven-year period compared to Hindus or other religious groups

compared to upper-caste groups (Brahmin and non-Brahmin) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are less likely to escape poverty and more likely to move into poverty

rural households, compared to urban households, are more likely to remain in poverty. They are also less likely to escape poverty and more likely to enter poverty than urban households

our findings suggest that poverty reduction efforts should focus on ways to improve the permanent economic status of households, possibly through acquisition of assets and capabilities, rather than on ways to deal with temporary volatility

Our findings also challenge the conventional wisdom that marginalized groups in India are catching up with the rest on average

# India and Free Trade Pacts

We should not fear signing free trade pacts as these can open up export opportunities for our industry

India’s early post-independence development strategy was marked by export pessimism

+ misplaced nationalistic approach of import substitution-led industrialization

This was done by keeping wage goods cheap and import tariffs very high. This meant food prices were kept very low, hurting farmers, whose predicament was worsened by policies such as compulsory monopoly procurement and control on movement of produce

High import tariffs on industrial goods shielded domestic industry from competition, and hence from the pressure to innovate and be cost efficient

Much later, the value of export-led growth based on the innate advantage of low labour costs was starkly revealed by the eye-popping growth of East Asian “tiger" economies, followed by China’s three decade-long growth run

Most of the objections to India’s signing up to RCEP stem from a fear of a flood of duty-free goods from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or China

why Indian producers don’t eye the large overseas market that will be available duty free for their own products and services if we sign up to RCEP

India’s share of global merchandise trade is less than 2% as against China’s 13%. Going from 2% to 4% is possible, even in a world driven by protectionist forces and a growth slowdown

It would call for a 100% jump in our exports, which is an important engine of domestic growth when other three are constrained (consumption spending, government spending, industrial investments)

Hence, it is imperative to pursue exports aggressively

For more than five years since 2014, the cumulative growth in exports was nearly zero, at a time when the world economy grew 23%. In garment exports, India lost out not just in relative but also in absolute terms to Bangladesh and Vietnam. Meat and leather exports suffered, so did gems and jewellery
