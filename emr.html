# Sovereign Bonds -- Criticism

could prove addictive

India’s sovereign external debt to gross domestic product (GDP) is among the lowest globally at less than 5%

consequences could be disastrous in the long run

almost all macroeconomic crises in emerging economies emanated from issues relating to foreign exchange

the Asian crisis of the late 1990s originated with unsustainable foreign currency debts, as have most macroeconomic crises in Latin America and Africa

Apart from 1991, which was a singular episode, triggered by the spike in oil prices and the collapse of remittances from workers abroad following the first Gulf War, India has been largely immune from major macroeconomic disturbances emanating from overseas.

Honey traps by Wall Street investment bankers -- offer the world, filled with risks

Not a protectionist argmument -- difference between free flow of goods and free flow of capital

# Democratic Education

our votes might be effective in throwing out the governments we dislike but are ineffective in giving us efficient and good governments

literacy and education by themselves do not create good citizens or mature democracies --> on qualifications for candidature

ability to imagine and achieve minimally common good --> conversations through debate, dialogue and deliberations

common and reciprocal sense of justice

good liberal arts education

# CAG audit report on indirect taxes

Implementation glitches, compliance burden has not gone down, revenue collections have not met expectations

Invoice matching is still not operational

system is prone to input tax credit (ITC) frauds

ITC means deducting the tax paid on inputs from the tax payable on the final output 

the manner in which the government devolved Rs 67,998 crore under integrated GST to states was “against the provisions of Constitution of India.”

lack of co-ordination between stakeholders

failure to test the systems before rolling them out

# Corporate Social Responsibility

companies have a social responsibility, but it is not to engage in philanthropy

their fundamental social responsibility is to generate wealth for their shareholders in a law-abiding, ethical and sustainable way. When they do that, they generate surpluses for society, provide consumers with goods and services that they need, create employment, purpose and dignity among workers, and strengthen the nation

The government can encourage this—through tax deductions, public acclamation and moral suasion—but has no business intervening in those decisions

forced expropriation of unspent funds and the introduction of jail terms for non-compliance is terrible

Flea on the elephant argument -- sports, aesthetics, art etc

# Dam Safety Bill

all above 15 meters, some specifications for the ones above 10-15 meters

constitution of a National Committee on Dam Safety (NCDS), which is to be chaired by the Central Water Commissioner (CWC)

The NCDS is to formulate policies for dam safety and to prevent dam failures. In the event of a dam failure, the NCDS will analyse why the failure occurred, and suggest changes in dam safety practices to ensure there aren’t any repetitions

formation of a National Dam Safety Authority (NDSA) -- for implementation

Unconstitutional -- water is a state subject

# Triple Talaq

473 cases in last 2 years -- after the SC judgement

the incidence of triple divorce is negligible and the issue was blown out of proportion for political reasons

the penal provision in the ordinance had no deterrent effect

there is a distinction between an act being declared “invalid” and being made an “offence”. The Supreme Court declared triple divorce as invalid and did not ask the government to make it a penal offence

Every punishment which does not arise from absolute necessity, according to Montesquieu, is tyrannical. In fact, criminal law should be used only as a “last resort” (ultima ratio) and only for the “most reprehensible wrongs”

Argument -- TT is a 'sin' under Islamic law -- hence it can be penalised -- Are we going in the direction of religious theocracy?

criminal law reflects the idea of “power” rather than “justice”

---

Claim -- it is a bailable offence. Reality -- judge's discretion

Bound to fail in oral divorces -- when no one other than the couple is present -- burden of proof

We are doing a huge disservice to Muslim women as no husband on his return from jail is likely to retain the wife on whose complaint he had gone to prison -- The Bill will lead to more divorces and abandonment

remedy to tackle triple divorce is thus worse than the disease

Three years’ imprisonment in the new Bill is excessive and is disproportionate. The Indian Penal Code provides far lesser sentences for graver crimes. The TTB obliterates the distinction between “minor” and “major” crimes

# India - Pak - Afghan -- Nirupama Subraminian

US need to engage with Pakistan on Afghanistan is greater than its need to isolate it

Delhi cannot push its own ties with Pakistan into a freezer and forget about them, and expect the world to forget about them too

Trump ready to make deals with Pakistan, the government cannot be as gung-ho about the BJP’s ideological projects in Kashmir

it is Delhi that is looking isolated on Afghanistan

# Investment

There is a lack of confidence in the ability of the leadership to convert the political promise of “ease of doing business” into bureaucratic performance

Investors look for macroeconomic stability and a supportive regulatory and policy environment. 

connected and efficient infrastructure and the easing of supply side “factor market” constraints

expeditious processes for land acquisition, flexible and unshackled labour policy and deepened capital markets unclogged from the choke of NPAs

They also want competitive tax rates, simplified procedures and transparent and fair mechanisms for dispute resolution

# Farming and Solar Evergy

why the annadata (farmer) cannot become the urjadata (producer of solar power)

doubling farmer's income + target of 100GW solar power by 2022

farmers occupy the largest chunks of land in this country. This model will be much more inclusive and can help augment their incomes significantly

Two variants --

Replace all pumpsets with solar pumps -- excess power could be brought by the state govts

encourage farmers to grow “solar trees” on their lands at a height of about 10-12 feet in a manner that enough sunlight keeps coming to plants below

Power generated in the second type is multiple times more than the previous one

# Mohan Bagan Victory -- Sports and Patriotism

1911 - Mohun Bagan defeated East Yorkshire Regiment to lift the Indian Football Association (IFA) Shield

Bagan represented a united Bengal

competed barefoot

exploded the myth that British were unbeatable

Macualay -- Bengalis more feeble than feminine traits

Vivakananda -- You will be nearer to heaven through football than through the study of the Gita (focus on physical fitness)
