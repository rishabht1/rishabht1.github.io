# Chief of Defence Staff

better coordination between the 3 services

as recommended by both the Kargil Review Committee led by K Subrahmanyam in 1999, as well as the Committee of Experts set up by Ministry of Defence under the chairmanship of General D B Shekatkar

it would be a four-star military officer, who would act as the single point adviser to the government on military matters

Modern military battles cannot be fought by each service fighting independently. The present Indian Armed Forces are colonial constructs and were configured primarily to serve the interest of their colonial masters during the great wars

the Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff (HQIDS) was created in October 2001. But, bureaucrats succeeded in stalling the appointment of the CDS by creating the perception that it would be far easier for a CDS to stage a coup

Consequently, an anomalous situation was created wherein an organisation was created, which has been functioning without a head for the past 18 years

---

class: center

The appointment of the CDS will make the armed forces more effective. However, the mere creation of the office is not enough. This will need to be augmented by restructuring of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and creating integrated theatre commands

The CDS has to be a cerebral warrior with good understanding of the global security environment and functioning of the three services. It should not be a rotational appointment; the government must select one after interviewing top officials of the three services

C - the bureaucrats afraid of losing their salience will create bottlenecks. On top of that, individual services, afraid of losing their turf, are bound to resist the CDS’s involvement in their affairs

For the CDS to be effective, he must have direct access to the defence minister and through him to the prime minister

Other info - 

India has had a feeble equivalent known as the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC); but this is a toothless office, given the manner in which it is structured. The seniormost among the three Service Chiefs is appointed to head the CoSC, an office that lapses with the incumbent’s retirement

---

class: center

R - concentrating too much military power in the CDS’s post

R - could disrupt civil-military ties in the latter’s favour

R - each Service has its own ethos, and the Chiefs feel that under a CDS, they will be rendered virtual nonentities

R - The smaller Air Force and Navy fear that the CDS would be from the Army, by far the largest Service

R - The IAF has long argued that unlike the United States and other western militaries, the Indian Services are not an expeditionary force, for which a CDS is a necessity

R - NSA v. CDS issue might come up

# Jal Jeevan Mission

plans to supply water to all households by 2024

C - the institutional landscape for water at both the Centre and state government has been somewhat fragmented, with several ministries in Delhi and departments in states dealing with different aspects of water management, with overlapping roles and responsibilities

S - No single body had the ultimate oversight and authority necessary to resolve conflicting issues and take the necessary decisions. The creation of the Jal Shakti Mantralaya in the Government of India to integrate the management of India’s water resources and supply of drinking water is a landmark step in diagnosing and addressing the problem

S - The proposed Jal Jeevan Mission will make source sustainability measures mandatory prior to pumping and distributing water to households

C - Another major issue with the traditional approach to service delivery was that the provision of drinking water was viewed primarily as an engineering solution, with schemes being planned and executed by the public health and engineering departments

---

class: center

S - water is an ideal sector for the applicability of the principle of subsidiarity — the idea that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed effectively at a more immediate or local level

Programmes like the Swajal project in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the WASMO programme in Gujarat, demonstrated that with adequate capacity building and training, water can be most efficiently managed at the lowest appropriate leve

C - Under the proposed Jal Jeevan Mission, with rural households planned to get household water supply, huge quantities of household waste water will be generated across the country, therefore making its effective management critical

S - It is, therefore, planned to include a mandatory provision under the Jal Jeevan Mission for the effective channeling and treatment of household waste water (known as grey water), through appropriate and low cost drainage and treatment systems

# Kannon

The Kodaiji Buddhist temple in Kyoto, Japan, is just 400 years old

Kannon is an android priest, with silicon skin and a camera for a left eye. It began conducting sermons earlier this year and preaches about compassion and the dangers of desire, anger and ego

Apart from the tricky theological questions, an android does provide the perfect vessel to preach detachment. When it talks of desire and ego, it can counsel without hypocrisy

The clergy at the Kodaiji temple reportedly hopes that Kannon will attract younger people, amongst whom the influence of religion is waning

# Economy and Confidence

The Reserve Bank of India’s quarterly surveys on consumer confidence, industrial outlook, households’ inflation expectations and industry’s order book, inventory and capacity utilization provide some assessment of these expectations

The RBI’s consumer confidence survey for the three months ended July 2019 indicates that households feel the economy has worsened since the previous quarter, with expectations of further worsening in the future

In such a situation, households typically postpone spending till there are clear signs of an improvement

A fresh jolt to confidence also seems to be in the offing. Bond yield curves across rich countries have started inverting, indicating that investors foresee greater stress in the near future than in the distant future

In a globally connected world, adverse economic trends travel from one geography to another through three channels: Trade, financial flows and confidence

---

class: center

India now has to contend with not only domestic confidence shocks—accumulated over the years through inflation, a bruised credit market leading to credit-averse financial agents, demonetization, a faulty goods and services tax structure, industry feeling victimized, direct tax uncertainty, farm income compression and rising unemployment—but also those washing up from overseas economies

S - push public sector undertakings (PSUs) for asset creation -- The government should use these funds for asset creation rather than balancing the fiscal deficit

S - direct government engagement -- A counter-cyclical fiscal policy is needed that favours expansion in times of a slowdown, but cuts back on expenditure during good times

At the heart of the logjam are amendments to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 (FRBM), introduced in 2018. These have squeezed government expenditure instead of redirecting it to productive uses

# Suffrage rights for women

19th Amendment - USA - 1920

one of the historic cases of pressure groups successfully and peacefully exapnding rights

The woman suffrage movement in India first gathered momentum due to female participation in the freedom struggle, beginning with the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal (1905-08), as well as support from British suffragists.

Different provinces of British India thus extended limited suffrage rights to women in the 1920’s. The Government of India Act 1935 expanded women’s suffrage, and even provided reserved seats for women in central and provincial legislatures

Full voting rights were awarded with the passing of the Indian Constitution in 1950, which provided for universal adult suffrage

# Disinvestment

Despite the government considerably diluting the conditions and sweetening the deal, it is finding it difficult to sell Air India.

If it tries to sell its assets more aggressively by offering, for example, attractive prices, it may stoke political objections. 

There is also the challenge of finding domestic buyers. If cash-rich businesses are only few, then it would also stoke allegations of favouritism.

If they are sold to foreigners, it could be all the more controversial. We do not know if foreign demand would exist, given the mounting uncertainties, except at throwaway prices.

Instead, the government could think of long-term leases for its land holdings, perhaps 99-year leases, like Singapore does.

# Renewable Hybrids

India has added 65-70GW of wind and solar capacity so far, with wind and solar contributing 9.5% of generated energy in May 2019

C - it relies on intermittent sources, producing energy only when the sun is shining or wind is blowing

C - its output is constrained to specific hours of the day

C - its use leads to lower utilization of transmission lines

This can create issues in matching peak power demand with renewable output (e.g. in evening hours when solar energy is not available), and raise costs of transmission

Experience in countries which have achieved renewable energy penetration of over 15% indicates that some flexible energy resources which can rapidly ramp up or down are needed. These could include hydro or gas-based power, or energy storage solutions

---

class: center

a hybrid system can combine wind, solar with an additional resource of generation or storage

in India, we observe that solar output is maximum between 11am and 3pm, while wind output is highest in late evening and early morning. Peak demand for power is reached in the evening hours of 6-9pm, which cannot be catered to by either wind or solar

If we can store some energy during excess renewable generation hours and release it into the grid during peak demand hours, the combined “hybrid" system can produce 24x7 clean energy in response to varying levels of demand through the day

The storage can take many forms, such as batteries, pumped hydro or mechanical storage through flywheels

Hybrid systems are expected to become increasingly cost competitive, driven by reducing costs of battery storage and solar energy. An optimal combination of solar, wind and storage can deliver stable round-the-clock power even at today’s costs of around ₹6-7/kWh

# Relevance/Significance of WTO

Trump's claim on India and China

Chinese rise and US fears are straining their bilateral trade and causing serious collateral damage to the institution that has served well the cause of trade, growth and stability of the world economy in the post-WWII period

Overall trade in goods has nearly quadrupled since 1995, while WTO members’ import tariffs have declined by an average of 15 per cent

Over half of world trade is now tariff-free (WTO, 2015)

WTO regulates more than 98 per cent of global trade flows among its members

It also monitors the implementation of free trade agreements, produces research on global trade and economic policy, and serves as a forum for settling trade disputes between nations

---

class: center

An alternate way to look at the WTO’s success is not to focus on how much trade it has helped create and the corresponding tariff reductions, but the damage in trade value it has helped avert. One estimate puts the value of avoided trade wars at $340 billion per year

a unilateral finding of unfair trading practices and subsequent action by the US ignoring their own WTO commitments, places other countries on higher moral ground

Unilateral measures are inconsistent with the letter and the spirit of multilateralism. Article 23 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) explicitly prohibits members from doing so

View - 1: US favouring
since dispute settlement in the WTO has become dysfunctional and appeals to the appellate body (AB) are taking longer than the prescribed 90 days, the US has taken matters in its own hands, playing the part of benign dictator for the common good.

C1 - the AB will cease to function in December unless the US agrees to appoint a replacement to maintain the required quorum of three members. Without the AB, the law of the jungle will replace the rule of law, hurting the weak and destroying the credibility of the entire process

---

class: center

The alternative, regionalism, involves a limited number of countries and ostensibly relies less on “altruism” of the members and more on mutual gain. But it suffers from an exclusionary bias

burden-sharing, as opposed to altruism among the big players, will remain an integral part of the multilateral approach

# India and Gulf

Delhi should support the region’s reform agenda, deepen economic and security cooperation.

Zayed Medal, the highest civilian honour in the Emirates,

If India tended to see the Gulf region through the prism of Pakistan in the past, it has now learnt that the conservative Gulf Kingdoms are quite eager to develop an independent relationship with Delhi

3 trends - 

some Gulf countries have expanded counter-terror cooperation with Delhi, extending support to India in the unfolding conflict over Jammu and Kashmir, and have sought to open the OIC platform for India despite Pakistan’s objections

recognising Modi’s special interest in the welfare of the Indian diaspora and expatriate labour, the Gulf kingdoms have begun to address many of the long-standing Indian concerns

the oil rich Gulf has begun to see India, one of the world’s leading energy importers, as a major economic partner.

---

class: center

The recent Saudi decision to pick up 20 per cent stake in the oil business of Reliance Industries Limited and UAE’s support for the construction of India’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve are two examples of deepening energy interdependence

Modi’s non-defensive and non-ideological approach to the Gulf has been a major contribution to India’s foreign policy

What India should do from here?

paying greater attention to the domestic dynamics in the different kingdoms of the Gulf amidst the region’s deepening political turbulence. One important new trend has been the effort to promote moderate Islam in the region

Supporting positive reform will lend greater weight to India’s concerns about the continuing negative trends in the region, such as the support for extremist ideologies

Delhi must reciprocate more productively to the enthusiasm in the Gulf region for strategic economic cooperation with India — ranging from energy and digital innovation to arms production and space technology

---

class: center

It is time Delhi showed some initiative to develop a more pro-active strategy for defence cooperation in the region

Thanks to the potential American retrenchment, the Gulf powers are recognising the importance of engaging each other. The recent talks on maritime security between UAE and Iran, who have had a troubled relationship for long, could be a sign of things to come

The question for India is no longer about taking sides; it is about contributing to the regional security in whatever manner it can

# CDS and Theatre Commands

To take the logic of the CDS to its conclusion, the Armed Forces must be operationally restructured into theatre commands—complete joint war-fighting formations—led by combatant commanders

Three theatres are straightforward: Northern, Western and Southern to address the threats from China, Pakistan and the Indian Ocean, respectively.

To these, I would add an eastern command for the Bay of Bengal littoral and an expeditionary command responsible for operations further afield

In the years ahead, a combination of climate change, violent non-state actors and volatile politics will increase the demands on the government to deploy military forces beyond the subcontinent. 

Despite a multitude of threats, India’s Armed Forces have very limited capacity to operate overseas. Hence, the need for an expeditionary command.

---

class: center

The first major task of the new CDS will thus be to conceptualize and implement the transformation of the forces into theatre commands

From a defence policy perspective, the CDS presents us with the opportunity to optimize defence economics and make expenditure more effective. 

the defence ministry needs economists. It has many accountants and finance professionals, but I am yet to see a defence economist in the government.

# Community based approach to businesses

Community-based businesses, where lenders and borrowers, investors and investees tend to be people with similar identity markers, tend to have fewer defaults and collapses of the magnitude of the global financial crisis

Reason: The funding commitments are not based just on rules, but also on ties of kinship and trust. Self-help groups also work for the same reason. Each member of the group knows other members fairly well, there is a reluctance to let the group down, and when someone faces trouble, the group pitches in with help

In his book, The Third Pillar, former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan notes that capitalism is in trouble because two of its pillars have grown too strong (state and markets), while the third pillar, the community, has weakened. 

If one were to look back at some of the biggest business houses today—the Tatas, Birlas, Goenkas, Singhanias, Chettiars, etc.—their initial rise to prominence did not depend only on formal financing. They depended on informal mutual support within their own communities

The point is that businesses today have to stand on two legs. One is formal finance from banks, private equity, venture capital or angel funds, the other is community finance and support

# Judicial Delays -- add on

the budget allocated to the judiciary is between 0.08 and 0.09 per cent of the GDP. Only four countries — Japan, Norway, Australia and Iceland — have a lesser budget allocation and they do not have any problem of pendency like we do

How do we define pendency? A case filed half an hour ago should not be counted in the pendency figures, as at present. For a start, let’s decide (arbitrarily) that only cases pending for more than one year will be counted. This will make a substantial and realistic difference and introduce some sense in understanding figures

Economic Survey and Ease of Doing Business Reports tell us that knee-jerk reactions do not work and the need is for systemic and structural reforms

# Microcredit

Microcredit refers to the granting of very small loans to impoverished borrowers, with the aim of enabling the borrowers to use that capital to become self-employed and strengthen their businesses.

Loans given as microcredit are often given to people who may lack collateral, credit history, or a steady source of income

The article in Ideas for India cites a 2015 study that found “a lack of evidence of transformative effects of microfinance on the average borrower”

Another study found that having access to microcredit made very little difference to changing the lifestyles of borrowers, based on six indicators: household business profits, business expenditures, business revenues, consumption, consumer durables spending, and spending on temptation goods

The primary reason for the lackadaisical effects of microcredit is the stringent repayment schedule offered by most microcredit institutions

The effect of this is that borrowers are unable to use the loans on investments that will take some time to be fully realised, and instead are forced to use the loans they receive on short term investments that only boost production to an extent, and the overall growth of their incomes remains meager.

class: center

S -- weekly to monthly (based on study)

As for the barriers to assessing credit risk, these can be mitigated by using community information.

Peer ranking

A study found that small microcredit loans can allow rural labourers –those who are employees, as opposed to entrepreneurs, who are employers– to migrate to urban areas to find work during the lean season, when there is no work to be found on farms

Those who migrated temporarily during this season experienced increased spending in both food and non-food areas, and increased their calories consumed

Studies conducted in Zambia and Kenya found that microcredit can be used in situations where seasonal factors cause drops in income to overcome these “seasonal credit crunches” and avoid taking decisions which cause people long-term negative impacts
