# Polygraph and Narcoanalysis

Polygraph -  based on the assumption that physiological responses that are triggered when a person is lying are different from what they would be otherwise

Instruments like cardio-cuffs or sensitive electrodes are attached to the person, and variables such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, change in sweat gland activity, blood flow, etc., are measured as questions are put to them. 

Narcoanalysis - involves the injection of a drug, sodium pentothal, which induces a hypnotic or sedated state in which the subject’s imagination is neutralised, and they are expected to divulge true information -- “truth serum”

India -- no lie detector tests should be administered “except on the basis of consent of the accused”

Those who volunteer must have access to a lawyer, and have the physical, emotional, and legal implications of the test explained to them by police and the lawyer,

The results of the tests cannot be considered to be “confessions”, because those in a drugged-induced state cannot exercise a choice in answering questions that are put to them.

However, any information or material subsequently discovered with the help of such a voluntarily-taken test can be admitted as evidence

# Governement Bailouts

K Subramanian, CEA -- bailouts amounts to socializing losses, and privatizing profits

The US government in 2009-09 had then unveiled a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to fund with taxpayer money the rescue of large financial services companies, some of them deemed “too big to fail"

bailouts go against the principles of free-market competition. They perversely reward poor business risk management at the cost of taxpayers, thus setting up a moral hazard—since businesses would be less likely to fear and mitigate their risks if they expect to be bailed out.

Are Indian private companies also getting overly dependent on public support? This is not clear, since many of them are merely asking the government to eliminate obstacles, rather than render financial help. 

So long as they seek reforms that allow market forces to operate freely, they should not be faulted

# Beijing and Kashmir

Despite the isolation of China at the UNSC, the message to India was clear: Beijing would join forces with Pakistan to hurt Indian interests at every possible forum

There were many in India who, rather unreasonably, expected China to moderate its behaviour vis-à-vis India in light of the so-called “Wuhan spirit".

By backing Pakistan’s request for the UNSC to discuss India’s latest move, China has signalled its priorities and made any normalization of ties almost impossible.

China’s response is also driven by its wider interests as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has pushed China to be even more aggressive on Kashmir

With China reportedly planning to set up a permanent military base in Pakistan for CPEC, India should be prepared for greater Chinese meddling on this matter

India’s deft diplomatic handling of the situation has ensured that China stands isolated at the UN. This has been happening repeatedly now. Earlier this year, China was isolated while trying to protect Masood Azhar from being declared a global terrorist, but had to later backtrack in the face of global opinion

as India becomes a more proactive player in the international order and China’s troubles with the rest of the world continue to grow, Beijing will target New Delhi even more pointedly

China can’t expect that its priorities on trade and 5G would be considered favourably by India if it continues to challenge the fundamentals of good neighbourly ties

If China is so aggressive on Kashmir, then nothing stops India from raking up issues like Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Tibet and Taiwan remain Chinese vulnerabilities

It should realize that there is no major constituency left in India today that has a favourable view of China

If China has a long-term strategy of containing India within South Asia, then India can just as easily adopt a strategy of challenging China’s core interests
