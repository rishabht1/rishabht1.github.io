# UNMOGIP -- G2

Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan

Pak has called for doubling the strength of MGOIP observers

redundant vestige of the past, long overtaken by the bilateral process agreed to under the Simla Agreement.

The UNMOGIP’s limited mandate renders it incapable of monitoring the terrorist havens on the Pakistani side of the LoC or preventing cross-border infiltration. Nor is it capable of preventing the frequent ceasefire violations

UNMOGIP’s annual budget of $19.7 million -- could be better utilised to achieve Sustainable Development Goals in developing countries, including for the long-suffering people of Pakistan, who have yet to realise their true potential as a result of the appalling policies and abysmally poor track record of successive Pakistani governments and military rulers

# Swiss Bank Details -- G3

On 22 November 2016, Switzerland and India signed a joint declaration on the introduction of the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) in tax matters on a reciprocal basis

This automatic exchange of information (AEOI) is to be carried out under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) -- The CRS has been developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)

# Interdiciplinary Forum for Economic Decision Making - G2

it is a commonplace barb that three economists in a room will eventually present four different views -- Niti, CEA, Nitin Gadkari all are speaking differnr things

This apparent lack of cohesion in economic thinking is worrisome because it makes one wonder whether there is any economic body in the government that has the mandate to look at the big picture — that is, evaluate the consequences of the macro impact of seemingly unrelated sectoral economic decisions — and also has the ear of the political leadership -- leads to avoidable systemic damage

whilst individual risks may rightly have been small, the collective impact of these risks could well trigger a systemic collapse

Our administrative apparatus is vertically structured within silo-ed compartments. Bureaucrats have a narrow remit and few, if any, have the mandate to take a broad view in order to evaluate the consequences of their decisions on the system as a whole. There is no forum to enable and facilitate interdisciplinary, interdepartmental and collaborative economic decision-making

# Informal sector and Economy - G3

Modi government has waged a war against the informal economy over the past five years

The Prime Minister and the government tend to conflate informality with corruption, and, in a misplaced effort to eliminate corruption, could end up killing the informal economy

more than 30% of the economy is completely informal, and perhaps 50% is quasi informal, and over two-thirds of the workforce is employed in informal enterprises

This makes the war on informality essentially a war on the economy. Demonetization is the best example and tragic consequence of this conflation

Another example, GST, has brought back the licence raj in a new avatar—the tax raj. GST imposes criminal penalties for a sale without an invoice, or misuse of tax refunds, manipulation of tax credits

In a country with an informal sector as large as India’s, and given high GST rates and complex compliance needs, the law effectively makes most businessmen criminals

Tax commissioners have wide powers to arrest people without registering an FIR or police complaint, and businessmen are left without the option of anticipatory bail

The government is enforcing the law to increase tax revenue, without realizing that it is killing the very activity that results in tax revenue

India has such a vast informal sector not because Indians like to operate in the shadows, but because the cost of doing business by following all regulations is too high

Instead of removing regulatory burdens, the Modi government has been aiming the state’s regulatory apparatus at them

WF - it needs to use this economic crisis to simplify the GST. The multiple rates, exceptions, cesses and surcharges need to be eliminated and replaced with one single GST rate across all goods and services, ideally below 15%

The GST compliance system needs a major rehaul, eliminating the need to file monthly returns. This will have a two-fold effect. The first is a major relief for the manufacturing and consumer goods sector, resulting in reduced prices to deal with the depressed demand. And, second, it will help recover the loss in business confidence

WF - The only way to end informality in the Indian economy is to make formal business operations cheaper. This requires a complete end to the inspector raj system and a simplification of regulations, starting with labour and land market rules

# Delhi and Europe -- PSIR/G2

C - Russian question - renewed tensions between Russia and the West have begun to shrink Delhi’s room for manoeuvre

No country has a higher stake than India in seeing a rapprochement between Russia and its European neighbours in the west and Japan in the east

France is eager to work with India in developing new coalitions to stabilise the Indo-Pacific -- France, a resident power in the Indo-Pacific, is eager work with India, Japan, Australia and other nations to prevent the littoral from becoming a hostage to the vagaries of US-China relations

problem of US-China tensions over trade that is affecting all major nations -- Working with Europe and Japan, however, might lend greater weight and credence to India’s trade diplomacy

India has a strong interest in joining the so-called “Alliance for Multilateralism” — a German initiative backed by France — that calls for modernising international institutions, strengthening the rules-based order and promoting global, rather than national, solutions to global challenges. It does not include the US, Russia and China, but is drawing many middle powers like Japan and Canada in the developed world and South Africa in the developing world

there is room for expansive cooperation between India and the Central European states. In sticking to its traditional method of engaging Europe through big powers, India has neglected the enormous possibilities for mutual enrichment with other European states as well as the European Union
